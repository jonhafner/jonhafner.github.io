<h1>Jon Hafner’s Tutoring Info</h1>

<p>
  <strong>Qualifications and Experience:</strong>  I have an M.S. in Mathematics, and I primarily work as a university math instructor.  I have tutored in some capacity on and off for over two decades.
</p>
<p>
  The courses I have taught at a university or college include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Math for Everyday Life / Contemporary Math</li>
  <li>Intermediate Algebra</li>
  <li>College Algebra / Algebra for Calculus</li>
  <li>Precalculus</li>
  <li>Calculus with Business Applications</li>
  <li>Analytic Geometry–Calculus I–III</li>
  <li>Intro to Ordinary Differential Equations</li>
  <li>Intro to Discrete Mathematics</li>
  <li>Basic Probability and Statistics</li>
</ul>
<p>
  I have also tutored students in a variety of other courses, including Linear Algebra, Applied Numerical Methods, and other topics ranging from basic arithmetic up through fourth-year undergraduate mathematics.  Furthermore, I have occasionally tutored adjacent subjects, including computer science, physics, and chemistry.  Those are outside my specialty, but I can usually be helpful at the introductory level.
</p>
<p>
  I also worked at a learning center for four years, primarily as a tutor for the ACT, SAT, and other standardized exams.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Fees:</strong>  My rate is $60/hour.  I offer a no-risk guarantee for the first hour: if it isn’t working out, we can stop there at no charge to you.  (No one has yet exercised that option, but I continue to offer it for potential clients’ peace of mind.)
</p>
<p>
  If I must drive a significant distance, I may need to also charge a per-session travel fee to cover my transportation expenses.  Inquire for details.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Medium:</strong>  I can meet with students in person or online.  The former is usually more effective, while the latter tends to be more convenient and flexible.  I typically conduct in-person sessions at a client’s home, or at a library, café, or some other public place.  For online meetings, I usually use Google Meet, but I’m open to trying other platforms if there is another one you prefer.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Payment methods:</strong>  I accept cash, checks, Zelle, PayPal, Google Pay, and possibly other methods upon request.  (Unless their policies have changed recently, I cannot accept Venmo or Apple Pay due to their restrictions.)
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Scheduling:</strong>  Inquire for current availability.  I’m generally pretty flexible with scheduling and rescheduling, within the bounds of my availability.<!--  However, due to my teaching schedule, I have a “second shift” sort of work and sleep cycle, making mornings inconvenient; I work best from the mid-afternoon through late evening.-->
</p>
