<h1>Jon Hafner’s Tutoring Info</h1>

<p>
  <strong>Qualifications and Experience:</strong>  I have an M.S. in Mathematics, and I have tutored in some capacity off and on for over two decades.  In recent years, my primary employment has been as an adjunct instructor of mathematics at the college and university level.  Prior to that, I worked for four years at a learning center, primarily as a tutor for the ACT, SAT, and other standardized exams.
</p>
<p>
  The courses I have taught at a college or university include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Math for Everyday Life / Contemporary Math</li>
  <li>Intermediate Algebra</li>
  <li>College Algebra</li>
  <li>Precalculus</li>
  <li>Intro to Discrete Math</li>
  <li>Calculus with Business Applications</li>
  <li>Calculus I–III</li>
  <li>Differential Equations</li>
</ul>
<p>
  I have also tutored students in a variety of other courses, including Linear Algebra, Applied Numerical Methods, and other topics ranging from basic arithmetic up through fourth-year undergraduate mathematics.  Furthermore, I have occasionally tutored adjacent subjects, including computer science, statistics, physics, and chemistry.  Those are outside my specialty, but I can usually be helpful at the introductory level.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Fees:</strong>  My rate is $80/hour.  I offer a no-risk guarantee for the first hour: if it isn’t working out, we can stop there at no charge to you.  (No one has yet exercised that option, but I continue to offer it for potential clients’ peace of mind.)
</p>
<p>
  If I must drive a significant distance, I may need to also charge a per-session travel fee to cover my transportation expenses.  Inquire for details.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Medium:</strong>  I can meet with students in person or online.  The former is usually more effective, while the latter tends to be more convenient and flexible.  I typically conduct in-person sessions at a client’s home, or at a library, café, or some other public place.  For online meetings, I usually use Google Meet, but I’m open to trying other platforms if there is another one you prefer.  (The chief exception is that I cannot use FaceTime, as I have no Apple devices.)
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Payment methods:</strong>  I accept cash, checks, PayPal, Google Pay, Zelle, and possibly other methods upon request.  (I cannot accept Venmo due to its policies on business transactions.  I also cannot accept Apple Pay because, again, I have no Apple devices.)
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Scheduling:</strong>  Inquire for availability.  I’m generally pretty flexible with scheduling and rescheduling, within the bounds of my availability.  However, due to my teaching schedule, I have a “second shift” sort of work and sleep cycle, making mornings inconvenient; I work best from the mid-afternoon through late evening.
</p>
