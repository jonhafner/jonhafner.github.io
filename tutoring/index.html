<h1>Jon Hafner’s Tutoring Info</h1>

<p>
  <strong>Qualifications and Experience:</strong>  I have tutored in some capacity off and on for roughly two decades.  In recent years, my primary employment has been as a part-time instructor in the Department of Mathematics at The University of Akron, from which I received my M.S. (Master of Science degree) in 2012.  I also taught at the Western Campus of the Cuyahoga Community College for a year.  Previous to that, I worked for four years primarily as a tutor for the ACT, SAT, and other standardized exams.
</p>
<p>
  The courses I have taught at UA or Tri-C include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Math for Everyday Life / Contemporary Math</li>
  <li>Intermediate Algebra</li>
  <li>College Algebra</li>
  <li>Precalculus</li>
  <li>Intro to Discrete Math</li>
  <li>Calculus with Business Applications</li>
  <li>Calculus I–III</li>
  <li>Differential Equations</li>
</ul>
<p>
  I have also tutored students in a variety of other courses, including Linear Algebra, Applied Numerical Methods, and other topics ranging from basic arithmetic up through fourth-year undergraduate mathematics.  Furthermore, I have occasionally tutored adjacent subjects, including computer science, statistics, physics, and chemistry.  Those are outside my specialty, but I can usually be helpful at the introductory level.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Fees:</strong>  My rate is $50/hour.  I offer a no-risk guarantee for the first hour: if it isn’t working out, we can stop there at no charge to you.  (No one has yet exercised that option, but I continue to offer it for potential clients’ peace of mind.)
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Medium:</strong>  When not in the middle of a global pandemic, I prefer to meet with students in person, but since that is not currently an option, I have temporarily switched to online instruction.  Now that Google Meet is free for everyone, that has become my preferred medium.  I have also used GoToMeeting, though it is slightly less ideal.  I am open to trying other platforms if there is another one you prefer.  (The chief exception is that I cannot use FaceTime, as I have no Apple devices.)
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Payment methods:</strong>  I accept Google Pay, PayPal, checks, and money orders.  (I also accept cash, of course, but that could be difficult to safely transfer currently.  I cannot accept Venmo due to its policies on business transactions.  I also cannot accept Apple Pay because, again, I have no Apple devices.)
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Scheduling:</strong>  Inquire for availability.  I am generally pretty flexible with scheduling and rescheduling, within the bounds of my availability.
</p>
