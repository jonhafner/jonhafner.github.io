<h1>Jon Hafner’s Tutoring Info</h1>

<p>
  <strong>Qualifications and Experience:</strong>  I have tutored in some capacity off and on for roughly two decades.  In recent years, my primary employment has been as a part-time instructor in the Department of Mathematics at The University of Akron, from which I received my M.S. (Master of Science degree) in 2012.  I also taught at the Western Campus of the Cuyahoga Community College for a year.  Previous to that, I worked for four years primarily as a tutor for the ACT, SAT, and other standardized exams.
</p>
<p>
  The courses I have taught at UA or Tri-C include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Math for Everyday Life / Contemporary Math</li>
  <li>Intermediate Algebra</li>
  <li>College Algebra</li>
  <li>Precalculus</li>
  <li>Intro to Discrete Math</li>
  <li>Calculus with Business Applications</li>
  <li>Calculus I–III</li>
  <li>Differential Equations</li>
</ul>
<p>
  I have also tutored students in a variety of other courses, including Linear Algebra, Applied Numerical Methods, and other topics ranging from basic arithmetic up through fourth-year undergraduate mathematics.  Furthermore, I have occasionally tutored adjacent subjects, including computer science, statistics, physics, and chemistry.  Those are outside my specialty, but I can usually be helpful at the introductory level.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Fees:</strong>  My standard rate is $50/hour (minimum 1 hour), plus a per-session travel fee, if applicable.  I offer a no-risk guarantee for the first hour: if it isn’t working out, we can stop there at no charge to you.  (No one has yet exercised that option, but I continue to offer it for potential clients’ peace of mind.)

  <p>
    To calculate what travel fee may be necessary, I first use Google Maps to determine the distance of the round trip to our meeting location from my home or office, depending on where I will usually be departing from or returning to based on our schedule.  (I live just south of Akron in the Portage Lakes area, and I work on the main UA campus.)  I then multiply that distance by the IRS standard mileage rate for the current year.  (For 2020, that’s 57.5¢/mile.)  I round down to the nearest multiple of $5, then absorb the first $5 of that cost myself.  Any excess, I must pass along to the client as a necessary charge to cover the cost of my transportation.
  </p>
  <p>
    I realize that the description of my method may sound somewhat esoteric or cumbersome.  When negotiating locations and schedules, I will calculate the relevant travel fees and share that information with you in advance, as I understand that it may impact your decisions.  I have no desire to surprise you with hidden fees!
  </p>

<p>
  <strong>Location:</strong>  With new clients, I usually conduct sessions in a public place, such as a library, café, or fast food restaurant.  (Some students prefer quiet and reserve study rooms in libraries, while others like a bit of background noise or the option to get a bit to eat or drink.  I have little preference myself.)  In-home tutoring may also be an option once we all get to know each other a bit, or if we connect through a personal referral.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Payment methods:</strong>  I accept cash, checks, and Google Pay.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Scheduling:</strong>  Inquire for availability.  I am generally pretty flexible with scheduling and rescheduling, within the bounds of my availability.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Contact:</strong>  If you have any questions or would like to set up a session, please email me at <a href="mailto:jon@hafner.us">jon@hafner.us</a> or text or call 330-524-7544.
