<h1>Jon Hafner’s Tutoring Info</h1>

<p>
  <strong>Qualifications and Experience:</strong>  I’ve tutored in some capacity off and on for about two decades now.  In recent years, my primary employment has been as a part-time instructor in the Department of Mathematics at The University of Akron, from which I received my M.S. (Master of Science degree) in 2012.  I also taught at the Western Campus of Cuyahoga Community College for a year.  In addition to the courses I’ve taught (see below), I’ve tutored many subjects ranging from basic arithmetic up through fourth-year undergraduate mathematics.  I also worked for several years primarily as a tutor for the ACT, SAT, and other standardized exams.

  <strong>Fees:</strong>  My standard rate is $50/hour (minimum 1 hour), plus a per-session travel fee, if applicable.  I offer a no-risk guarantee for the first hour: if it isn’t working out, we can stop there at no charge to you.  (No one has yet exercised that option, but I continue to offer it for potential clients’ peace of mind.)

  <p>
    To calculate what travel fee may be necessary, I first use Google Maps to determine the distance of the round trip to our meeting location from my home or office, depending on where I’ll usually be departing from or returning to based on our schedule.  (I live just south of Akron in the Portage Lakes area, and I work on the main UAkron campus.)  I then multiply that distance by the IRS standard mileage rate for the current year.  (For example, for 2019, that’s 58¢/mile.)  I round down to the nearest multiple of $5, then absorb the first $5 of that cost myself.  Any excess, I must pass along to the client as a necessary premium to cover the cost of my transportation.
  </p>
  <p>
    I realize that my method may sound somewhat esoteric or cumbersome.  When negotiating locations and schedules, I will calculate the relevant travel fees and share that information with you in advance, as I understand that it may impact your decisions.  I have no intent to smuggle in hidden fees!
  </p>

<p>
  <strong>Location:</strong>  With new clients, I usually conduct sessions in a public place, such as a library, café, or fast food restaurant.  (Some students prefer quiet and reserve study rooms in libraries, while others like a bit of background noise or the option to get a bit to eat or drink.  I have little preference myself.)  In-home tutoring may also be an option once we all get to know each other a bit, or if we connect through a personal referral.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Scheduling:</strong>  Inquire for availability.  I’m generally pretty flexible with scheduling and rescheduling, within the bounds of my availability.
