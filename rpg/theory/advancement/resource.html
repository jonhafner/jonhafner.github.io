<h1>Advancement</h1>
<h2>XP as a resource</h2>

<p>
  Players most familiar with the 4th and 5th editions of D&amp;D probably think of XP is a stable value that always increases, like some sort of progress meter.  Players of AD&amp;D probably think similarly, with the exception that sometimes it can <em>drop</em>, most commonly if you are unfortunate enough to have a run-in with certain level-draining undead.
</p>
<p>
  However, to players of skill-based games like the Story* Systems, XP might be thought of more naturally as a resource you can spend to improve your character in various ways.  Even in D&amp;D, it’s technically a resource, albeit one with few or no choices to make: when you’ve earned enough of it, you “spend” the required amount of XP to gain a level.  If you can make a choice at all, it’s only in deciding which class to level up (if your multiclassing rules work that way).
</p>
<p>
  Players of 3e might find this a little surprising, because of <em>course</em> XP is a resource—one which is spent not only to gain levels, but also to create magic items or cast powerful spells, particularly those with significant, permanent effects.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Numenera</em> clearly treats XP even more as a resource, as it is not only spent to increase your character’s abilities, but also to gain various short-, medium-, or long-term benefits, and even for the immediate effect of rerolling a die or denying a GM intrusion.  (One of the designers stated at some point that the intent was for roughly half the XP a player earns to be spent for rerolls or short-term benefits, and the other half for advancement.  However, they have observed that some players are extremely hesitant to spend XP for short-term gains, instead “hoarding” them for advancement.  Another part of the design intent was for roughly half of a PC’s XP gains to come from GM Intrusions, and the other half from making discoveries.  Combining these ideas, they suggested that if your group suffers from that problem, you might instead make these two separate kinds of XP: points from GM Intrusions can be spent for circumstantial benefits, and points from discovery are spent on advancement.)
</p>
<p>
  I don’t think it’s a coincidence that Monte Cook, creator of <em>Numenera</em>, was one of the three lead designers of 3e.  Both of these games—<em>Numenera</em> especially, but 3e to a lesser extent—appear to conceptualize XP as a means by which players can exert narrative control over the game, changing aspects of their character or the game world around them.
</p>
<p>
  Cook’s games are by no means the only ones to take this position.  For example, consider this sidebar from V5 (<em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em>, 5th edition), p.180:
</p>
<blockquote>
  GAINING AND LOSING ADVANTAGES
  <p>
    Events during the chronicle can change a character’s Advantage [<em>sic</em>] and Flaws, especially Backgrounds.  A Haven can burn down, an Ally can turn on you if you betray them, or the cops can gun down a Retainer for no reason at all.  Conversely, by desperate quest or clever machination you can acquire an Advantage; the dots fluctuate along with your character’s fortunes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The basic rule is this: a character should be able to get back, or at least replace, lost Advantages that have been gained by spending experience points or during character creation.  If something is gained without the equivalent expenditure of experience points, it should be temporary at best.
  </p>
  <p>
    Example: Katya has brought a number of gullible mortals under her heel, roughly the equivalent of a couple of dots of Allies.  As long as she doesn’t solidify her acquisition with experience points, these allies will likely only be available this story.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The wording is clumsy, but there’s a clear idea that players spend XP to make permanent-ish statements about their character and how they relate to the game world.  This is an interesting perspective to possibly keep in mind in other games as well.
