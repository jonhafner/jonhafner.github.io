<h1>Advancement</h1>
<h2>Training</h2>

<p>
  There are several approaches to the question of training, and you can reasonably arrive at various conclusions, depending on both what seems plausible to you and what your goals are for a game.  But first:
</p>

<h3>What even is training?</h3>
<p>
  I keep using the word “training” for simplicity, but the concept is actually much more general than that, referring to basically any non-adventuring activity that consumes money and downtime and makes the character better at what they do.  Sure, a fighter might pay someone to train them in the traditional sense, or they might find other ways to hone their skills.  A wizard might pay a tutor or mentor, or just purchase tomes to study from, or pay for access to a wizard college library.  A thief might spend their time and money mostly on carousing and making contacts and greasing wheels, in addition to sometimes paying people to teach them specific skills.  A cleric might need to tithe heavily to their church for greater access to the high priests, or perhaps just spend most of their spare time and money directly furthering the cause of their deity to earn their favor.  And so forth.
</p>
<p>
  With that in mind, how might this fit into a game?
</p>

<h3>No training needed</h3>
<p>
  One camp holds that training is not worth considering.  PCs meet the requirement set for advancement—whether that’s earning XP by defeating monsters or hitting enough milestones by completing quests and story goals or whatever else—and then they level up.  Sure, it should take some time to let your experiences really sink in, but that can be hand-waved as happening while resting, traveling, etc.
</p>
<p>
  This is probably the most common paradigm in practice, since most groups are probably far more interested in going on adventures than they are in tracking downtime!  Still, there are alternatives that might be worth considering for certain types of games.
</p>

<h3>Training is everything</h3>
<p>
  The exact opposite approach is also a valid position.  One GM (who doesn’t use XP) pointed out that “People that play professional sports don’t get better because of the game they play, they get better because they spend time in practice and training.  Any particular sports game is just one tiny fraction of the time spent on improving skill.”  An argument can be made that the things you do during an adventure actually do very little to increase your personal abilities; rather, the fastest way to improve is usually through intentional practice and/or study.  Real-world practical experience isn’t nothing, but it’s not usually the most efficient route to improvement.
</p>
<p>
  This might suggest a system in which level advancement is achieved solely through the quantity and quality of training.  But training consumes time and money—and time also consumes money, as you have to pay for food and lodging and whatnot.  You can save some time by improving the quality of your training, but that gets <em>expensive</em>.  The quickest way to fund a rapid growth in personal power is probably to go on treasure-hunting expeditions, or cash in on bounties, or take on other high-risk, high-reward jobs.  (Along the way, you may even find some rare and powerful items that you can put to good use as well.)
</p>
<p>
  This doesn’t mean that only ruthless mercenaries become adventurers: Defeating evil for its own sake can also be a great way to improve your reputation, perhaps earning the attention of wealthier and more powerful patrons, perhaps earning you some land and a noble title, perhaps earning some followers, etc.
</p>
<p>
  Implementing something like this may require some care.  For example, to discourage players from just selling <em>everything</em> they find, perhaps limit the market for magic items: they have to work pretty hard to find a buyer, and even then, they might be selling it at a loss, so unless it’s something they really have no use for….  Also, if you want players to spend money building strongholds and hiring followers and whatnot, you’ll have to make sure that such things are a worthwhile expenditure relative to the alternatives.  Although, perhaps if the training costs for each level escalate quickly enough, that will take care of itself, as even these expensive endeavors can become cheaper ways to increase your personal power than gaining another level would be?
</p>

<h3>Both are useful</h3>
<p>
  Like I said, real-world practical experience isn’t nothing, even if it’s not the most efficient.  Perhaps <em>both</em> training and experience can contribute toward advancement.  You can decide where the balance should be and set the conversion factor—can training be an option to gain a few extra XP, or can a full day of adventuring count as a (risky and strenuous) day of training?
</p>
<p>
  If you want to explain how high-level NPCs can exist who <em>aren’t</em> adventurers, but in which it still makes sense to take the extreme risks inherent in the adventuring life, consider a system that permits relatively rapid advancement through adventuring but also allows XP to be earned very slowly through training during downtime.  This sort of approach is rare in games resembling D&amp;D, but it is somewhat more common in skill-based games.
</p>
<p>
  For example, I gathered from one source that in <em>Burning Wheel</em>, advancement usually occurs by using a skill during play, but you can spend some time practicing—whether during downtime, or during an adventure by taking actions that have no real challenge and risk—to earn something like one-tenth the usual progress for advancement.
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Blades in the Dark</em> SRD has this line:  “You can also earn xp by training during downtime.  When you train, mark xp in one of your attributes or in your playbook.  A given xp track can be trained only once per downtime phase.”  (There are several codified downtime activities, each with their own benefits, and you can only pick two per unit of downtime.  Spending one of those on training means you’re giving up the opportunity to do something else, and it looks like you can often gain <em>several</em> XP in a single session of play, so training is just a small boost to advancement, not a major accelerant.)
</p>
<p>
  For something like the Story* Systems, it might be reasonable to allow a character who has the means and opportunity to perform intensive practice or study toward something to earn, say, 1 XP per week or month of downtime toward that thing?  This would not be your primary means of advancement, but something you might be able to do while traveling, perhaps, or while waiting for another character to finish another task, or whatever.
</p>
<p>
  It’s possible that this idea appeals to you only for verisimilitude, and you don’t actually want your players to mess with it.  That’s actually fine; you don’t even need to work out a precise system, really, if you operate under the assumption that gaining XP through non-adventuring means would take so long as to not even register on the timescale of an adventure.  PCs go adventuring to level up quickly with great risks; characters who take the long but safe route are NPCs!
</p>

<h3>Both are essential</h3>
<p>
  Some editions of D&amp;D have had rules—sometimes core, sometimes optional—<em>requiring</em> characters to spend time and money training under a skilled tutor after they have earned enough XP to advance a level.  This is a transparent ruse to siphon off some cash from players, and while it can be defended as an <em>option</em>, it’s difficult to justify as a <em>requirement</em>.  The idea that nobody can improve their skills without paying an instructor of higher level is a tough one to swallow, especially if no suitable instructors are anywhere to be found!  (Particularly in a low-magic game, it might not take long before the PCs themselves are the highest-level fighters, wizards, and priests in the entire region.)
</p>
<p>
  However, it does seem reasonable to require both training and practical experience.  A soldier needs a certain amount of training to have a chance at surviving a battle, but no amount of training can produce a seasoned, battle-hardened veteran.  A wizard needs to study and research to learn new spells and techniques, but time in a library will not prepare you for casting an intricate spell at an archdevil while the legions of Hell tear at your friends mere feet away.
</p>
<p>
  So, you can reasonably retain a more standard system of advancement while also having some sort of “cooldown” on how quickly (in game time) a character can gain levels.  Perhaps a certain amount of downtime must be spent reflecting and practicing to assimilate what one has learned into refined practical techniques?  This helps avoid implausible situations like a group of characters engaging in several dangerous fights a day gaining, like, three levels over the course of a week, or something.  Possibly just require, like, a week per level of total accumulated downtime since the last level-up?  This can include casual travel, etc.  Just to moderate pacing.
</p>
<p>
  If such downtime is required, spending time and money on actively training could conceivably accelerate that process; just spitballing, perhaps each day spent in paid active training counts as two, three, or even four days toward advancement.  The cost per time unit of instruction should probably increase based on the character’s level and means, but I don’t think a precise formula is warranted; instead, it’s much more interesting and realistic to have this depend on the individual tutor.  Costs of various goods and services can give an idea of what a day’s labor is worth at the lower end for common trades, and the cost of magic items can be compared to the time required to craft them to give some idea of what a spellcaster’s time is worth at various levels.  You need a tutor of higher level than you, but you probably don’t want one <em>too</em> much higher, since the more power and status they have, the more their time is worth.
</p>

<h3>Training is (almost) useless</h3>
<h4>(or: “Adventuring ain’t like dusting crops, boy!”)</h4>
<p>
  Consider the dean of a wizard’s college.  They can cast high-level arcane spells, so they must be a high-level wizard, right?  Well, <em>sort of</em>, but not in the way you might think.  The PC class called “wizard” is an <em>adventuring</em> wizard, not a bookish or bureaucratic one.
</p>
<p>
  Using 3e rules for the sake of illustration, take a 20th level wizard, strip him of all clothing and gear, and drop him into a dead-magic zone.  He has no equipment and no magic, but what he <em>does</em> have are about 50hp and two attacks per round at +10/+5.  Put him up against a standard 1st level fighter with typical starting gear, and the naked wizard has a nontrivial chance of being able to kill the armed and armored fighter with his bare hands.  Give him a simple quarterstaff, and now the odds shift significantly in his favor.
</p>
<p>
  Does this sound like the typical college dean to you?  Probably not.  Unlike the dean, our adventuring wizard has <em>seen some shit</em> and survived to tell the tale.  Learning how to cast powerful spells in controlled circumstances is one thing; learning how to successfully cast powerful spells while a goblin is trying to slice your bowels open, an illithid is trying to eat your brain, or a stone giant is trying to grind you into a pulp is another matter entirely.
</p>
<p>
  So, sure, that dean probably has levels of <em>something</em>, but it’s probably some sort of NPC class like “scholarly wizard”.  Months or years of dedicated study can grant a level of this class, which provides the usual wizardly spellcasting abilities, but with zero BAB, zero hp above 1st level, zero Fortitude and Reflex saves, and <em>at best</em> “average” (not good) Will saves.  One could also imagine a “cloistered priest” that functions similarly.
</p>
<p>
  In other words, the classes in the PHB are for <em>adventurers</em>, and you get better at those things by <em>adventuring</em>, not sitting at home training.  Sure, you might be required to take a bit of downtime to assimilate what you’ve learned and gain a level, but that’s it.  (That suggestion above about a week per level “cooldown” between level gains is probably a reasonable pace; you can adjust it up or down based on the needs and style of your game.)
</p>
<p>
  To represent non-adventuring NPCs, you can just give them the abilities you would expect them to have, but not all the features of a PC class.  A master tailor will have plenty of skill ranks—not just in the actual craft, but also in skills related to running a business, and perhaps some etiquette or diplomacy for interacting with noble clientele—but practically no combat ability.  A king <em>might</em> have the combat prowess of a low-level fighter if he had a little bit of military training as part of his noble upbringing, but nothing that would stand up to mid-level adventurers.  His royal guard, on the other hand….
