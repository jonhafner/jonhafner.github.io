<h1>Advancement</h1>
<h2>XP for what?</h2>

<p>
  Once you understand <a href="what.html">the true purpose of XP</a> and have made <a href="why.html">the active decision to use them</a> (or recognize them as essential for your game), you then need to determine what things earn XP awards.  Bear in mind that players are motivated to do the things that earn XP for their characters, so make sure you’re incentivizing the behavior you actually want.
</p>
<p>
  Ideally, players should want to do the things that earn them XP even if there were no XP in the game: in a typical D&amp;D-like game, players should want to find treasure to further their goals, they should want to overcome monsters and other challenges as a means to obtaining treasure or other goals (and those systems, such as combat, should be fun in and of themselves), they should want to achieve story goals to gain a sense of accomplishment and feel like heroes, and so forth.  Your choice of what to award XP for, then, determines what activities take priority and govern the pacing of the game.
</p>
<p>
  So, with that in mind, what <em>should</em> you award XP for?  Several possibilities follow.  Keep in mind that most of them are not mutually exclusive: for example, the 3e DMG includes guidelines for cutting encounter XP in half and allocating the rest to story rewards.  Select the factor or factors that you feel should incentivize players and govern the pace of your game.  If you want a game about looting and pillaging, <a href="#treasure">award XP for treasure found</a>; if you want a game about exploration, <a href="#discoveries">award XP for making discoveries</a>.  If you want a game about adventurous treasure hunters, perhaps award XP for both treasure <em>and</em> discoveries.  If you have a clear vision, don’t overcomplicate things.

<h3 id="sessions">Play sessions/time</h3>
  <p>
    One of the simplest ways to track progress toward advancement is to simply count sessions of play.  The DMGs for all three modern (WotC) editions of D&amp;D include mentions of the expected number of sessions per level.  It is possible to simply award a level to each character after the appropriate number of sessions.  Of course, you may need to adjust the suggested numbers based on the durations of your sessions: a game played daily during a lunch break and a monthly marathon session lasting all Saturday are not equal.  Some games actually base XP on the number of hours played; this could be useful if your sessions vary in length.
  </p>
  <p>
    This method of counting sessions or tracking time is easy, but it fails to account for many practical realities.  Have you ever had a group of players spend an hour spinning their wheels overthinking a puzzle in a dungeon?  Or spend an entire session just going shopping and chatting with locals in town?  And then the same group can turn around the next week and slaughter a dozen goblins, stop an evil ritual, uncover lost secrets, and return the blacksmith’s daughter safe and sound, all in a single session.  If you adapt their pace based on what they actually accomplish, you need to establish criteria by which to do so, and at that point, you’re basically reinventing another XP system.  Furthermore, your players are likely to become frustrated by not knowing how close they are to their next level.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, if you <em>don’t</em> adapt their pace to circumstances, and you always award levels after the same number of sessions or hours no matter what, players will notice, and they might start to feel like it doesn’t actually matter what they do, since they’ll level up all the same anyway.  Alternatively, they may start to intentionally stall, dragging their feet in real-world play time to get a new level shortly <em>before</em> that big boss fight they know is coming up, for instance.  This is probably not desirable behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
    Still, if the GM and players are able to keep sessions relatively consistent in their perceived (not necessarily actual) significance, this can work very well.  <em>Shadow of the Demon Lord</em> uses a system close to this—at least, when played as intended.  Technically, it’s level-by-fiat, but the expectation is that PCs will gain a level after each adventure, and published adventures are short, so it’s entirely possible to play a level 0–10 complete campaign in exactly eleven sessions.  (SotDL was designed for busy adults who want to get shit done.)
  </p>

<h3 id="milestones">Milestones and story rewards</h3>
  <p>
    Significant achievements can count as “milestones” toward advancement.  At one extreme, you can consider only truly major milestones, and let each one account for one (or more) levels.  With this approach, you will typically instruct players to level up after completing a major quest or other significant achievement, or at the conclusion of a “chapter” of the story; these are generally the most dramatically satisfying times.  Alternatively, the choice may be driven by the story in other ways, with the DM awarding levels as needed to ensure that the players are prepared for the upcoming challenges planned.
  </p>
  <p>
    This probably works best if you have a rough plot worked out for your campaign, broken up into arcs or chapters; it makes a great deal of sense to use these to guide the pace of leveling up the PCs.  (Some call this “leveling at the speed of plot”.)  Not only is it convenient, but it can actually create a situation where the mechanics reinforce the story: the sudden increase in personal power or introduction of new abilities coincides with the narrative growth of the character as they move into a new chapter, in more ways than one.  For example, in the first campaign of <em>The Adventure Zone</em>, the DM had the players gain <em>two</em> levels after each story arc was complete, before sending them out on their next mission.  Even setting aside concerns for the listener, leveling up in the middle of a mission would disrupt the narrative flow and perhaps complicate episode scheduling.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the structure of your campaign does not lend itself to such an approach (or if your players are frustrated by not having a clear, concrete measure of their progress toward their next level), you might find it easier to use smaller, more granular milestones: accomplishing a goal, discovering something important, reaching an important destination, etc.  You can decide on the number of milestones needed to progress, or you can tack them onto an existing XP-based system; again, the modern DMGs include advice for assigning XP values to story rewards.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Professor Dungeon Master’s system, as described in his Dungeon Craft video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oju4v_yUrpc">D&amp;D XP the Fast &amp; Easy Way!</a>, roughly half the XP the PCs earn come from “achieving scenario objectives”.  (The other half come from his assessment of the difficulty of the challenges they face each session.)  In his system, it takes 10 XP to gain a level.  Examples of 1-point scenario objectives from his current campaign include getting the owlbear head for the innkeeper, or retrieving the witch’s elven boots from the owlbear den; locating and liberating a group of prisoners or stopping the cultists from summoning a demon that’ll destroy the entire town might be worth 2 points each.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also make milestones more personalized; especially in a more story-based game, it would make sense to grant individual XP awards for completing personal goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    This system can feel very natural and satisfying; it avoids the tedious bookkeeping of tracking each individual encounter, instead awarding XP at times that feel narratively appropriate.  However, you do have some decisions to make regarding the relative value of the milestones:  Are all milestones equal, or are some more valuable than others?  Is the value of a milestone based on its narrative or psychological significance, or on the difficulty of achieving it?  What if the players achieve a major milestone very quickly and easily, whether through cleverness or sheer luck?  Is it still worth its full amount, even though that might make for unexpectedly rapid advancement?  Are you awarding XP solely for the end results, or should they represent the character actually <em>learning</em> something, ideally through adversity?
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, consider the possible degenerate case of a party who completes small tasks, gets into fights, discovers some interesting information or items, but for whatever reason, never manages to successfuly complete any of the quests or goals set as milestones.  Do they never advance, then?  Can they get “stuck” if they aren’t able to progress?  Or what if they decide they want to do things that matter to them, rather than follow the story you’ve laid out for them?  Are you prepared to adapt accordingly?  If not, you should ensure that expectations are clearly discussed before play begins!  Also, are you sure you can clearly identify coherent milestones?  This might not be hard if you have a plot prepared and have buy-in from the players to follow your threads, but what about a large dungeon crawl, or a sandbox campaign?  If you scatter small milestones throughout, can you be sure that the players will complete them at a reasonable pace, or might they get clumped together, or skipped entirely?  Milestone advancement is very popular among DMs seeking to avoid messing with traditional XP, but make sure you have a clear understanding of how it will operate in your campaign.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to avoid these problems but you’re having trouble letting go of “story rewards”, keep in mind that most of them already carry their own rewards, and need no further incentives:  If you complete a quest for someone, they presumably will compensate you with payment or some other reward they have promised you.  If you do good things without payment, that tends to yield other benefits, perhaps in the longer term.  (For example, doing something to help some poor sod leaves that person indebted to you; also, they are likely to spread word of your greatness, which improves your reputation, brings you to the attention of more powerful patrons, etc.)  If you achieve a personal goal, well, that’s something you’ve gained right there, assuming the goal actually meant something and wasn’t completely arbitrary.  You don’t really need more XP for such things.  Awarding XP for “story rewards” is a perfectly valid approach, but by no means necessary.
  </p>

<h3 id="treasure">Treasure</h3>
  <p>
    Quite famously, the primary source of XP in 0e and 1e was the standard award of 1 XP for each gp worth of treasure you found/<wbr>recovered.  This synergized with the core goals of the game: find treasure and either spend it or use it.  If this is what your game is about, it’s still a good system, as it clearly incentivizes players to obtain their goal as efficiently as possible; if you can use skill or trickery to avoid a fight, so much the better!  As one observer remarked, “Players joke that D&amp;D is about killing things and taking their stuff, but in the original game, you were better off using your wits to take stuff.  So long as your cunning led to gold, you got experience.”
  </p>
  <p>
    However, if you try this now, you might have some rescaling work to do.  Early level advancement charts were approximately exponential—which makes sense when the rewards are fixed rather than relative—so that led to the problems of explaining the incredible vastness of monster hoards, dealing with the subsequent devestation to local economies wrought by its recovery, and also trying to find something for players to do with all that treasure!  To siphon some of this off, Gygax introduced high training costs for advancing levels, and even taxes; aside from being tedious and boring, the latter is also absurd.  <a href="https://dmdavid.com/tag/dungeons-dragons-stopped-giving-xp-for-gold-but-the-insane-economy-remains/">As DM David said</a>, “Gary spent a page arguing that taxes add <em>realism</em>, forgetting that no sensible tax collector targets a powerful band of killers, especially if they sometimes prove useful finding missing heirs, thwarting attempts to summon demon gods, and whatnot.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Another reason to be cautious with this method is that treasure is fundamentally its own reward.  Some characters want it for its own sake, but even those not motivated by greed have reason to seek out valuables:  Everyone needs food and lodging and equipment, and any surplus can be used to purchase better equipment, a stronghold, reputation, and so on; building a temple, raising an army, establishing a spy network, whatever.  And we haven’t even mentioned the immediate usefulness of magic items.  There’s probably no need to double down on this incentive, unless you really want to make the game centrally about treasure-hunting.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is another serious concern, and that is the difficulty it creates for certain character concepts, such as a traveling monk with a vow of poverty.  Do they still need to pillage loot to pay for training to advance in levels?  That feels weird.  That doesn’t mean this is a bad idea, just that it only makes sense for a <em>very specific kind</em> of campaign, and everyone needs to be on board with that.  That traveling monk might be more at home in another game.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you <em>do</em> want to make treasure the primary reward mechanism, you might consider simply dropping XP altogether, instead setting costs for <a href="training.html">training</a> to the next level.  Individual players can then choose how to spend their treasure to increase their power: by training up their personal power, or by paying for hirelings, magic items, or other resources.  (This roughly parallels the 3e notion of <a href="resource.html">paying XP</a> for creating magic items or casting permanent spells; in earlier and later editions, these costs were measured solely in gold, never experience.  They should cost <em>something</em>, but it doesn’t much matter what!)
  </p>

<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
  <p>
    Challenges are the primary source of XP in most editions of D&amp;D and many RPGs descended from it.  Every edition of D&amp;D awards XP for defeating monsters (even if that was dwarfed by the awards for treasure in the earliest editions), and the modern editions include guidelines for also awarding XP for traps and other hazards, and sometimes puzzles and other obstacles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using this well requires some care, as bluntly awarding XP only for creatures killed tends to lead to the problem of “murder-hobo” characters, those with a tendency to slaughter everything they encounter.  It is important to allow for other kinds of victory over foes, such as forcing them to surrender or flee, successfully intimidating or persuading them, etc.  In some cases, such as traps or hazards, “victory” might involve disarming or disabling the threat, or it might be merely <em>surviving</em>.  The key phrase to keep in mind here is “overcoming challenges”, which is intentionally vague to allow for players’ creative solutions to problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the purpose of regulating the pace of a game, you could certainly do worse than to keep track of the challenges they face.  After confronting a good mix of several easy, moderate, and hard challenges, your players will probably be ready for a level-up.  This is also plausible in the fiction of the game, for you learn the most from things that challenge you, right?  If you only ever do things that are easy, you won’t really improve much.  So, defeating a foe in combat, or getting past a dangerous trap, or successfully navigating a tense negotiation … all of these carry risks, and avoiding the negative consequences requires some combination of skill, luck, and cleverness.  Or, maybe you don’t avoid the consequences, but you survive anyway; “The greatest teacher, failure is.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, the key to making this work is to interpret “challenge” broadly as anything that carries a risk of failure, with consequences for failing.  Tricking a guard into leaving their post, sneaking past a sentry, or negotiating a trade deal with a dwarf lord could all count as overcoming challenges.  Professor Dungeon Master <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oju4v_yUrpc">describes</a> challenges as obstacles, giving examples of a menacing ogre, a scheming politician, or a trapped room.  In discussions of <em>Dungeon Crawl Classics</em> (DCC), at least one GM interpreted “encounters” as including dealing with a tight-lipped sage, or getting the right people drunk.  Someone else mentioned diplomatic negotiations, racing through the city to catch a fleeing burglar, or several days of overland travel to find a hidden cave.  “If it was tricky and took some work on the players’ parts, or cost the characters something in terms of possessions or abilities or the like, it’s probably worth some XP.”
  </p>
  <p>
    If you do use this system, be sure to make it very clear to your players that nonlethal solutions are worth just as much XP, so they don’t think they’re <em>supposed</em> to just kill everything!  As long as that’s handled well, though, this approach promotes what’s probably the most iconic and expected form of the core experience.
  </p>

<h3 id="skill-use">Skill use</h3>
  <p>
    One of the reasons awarding XP for overcoming challenges (see the previous section) tends to be so popular and work so well in D&amp;D is probably because accumulating XP leads to advancing levels, and advancing levels improves your ability to overcome those very challenges.  <em>Every</em> class, even the most bookish wizard, increases attack bonuses and hit point totals with rising levels, improving a character’s abilities with combat.  Along with this come new abilities or improvements to existing abilities that can do a variety of things, but even those that don’t directly apply to combat usually pertain to overcoming <em>some</em> sort of challenge.  So in a certain sense, XP awarded for overcoming challenges are a very general, abstract, non-specific way of making a character better at the things they do, more or less.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some game systems make this a bit more explicit.  For example, many early games, including Arneson’s <em>Blackmoor</em>, awarded XP for characters doing things that improved their skills—for practice, basically.  So, a fighter got better at fighting by defeating opponents.  This meant, though, that a wizard was best off spending his time in his library or laboratory, not out risking his life in dungeons.  This is a good simulation, but it introduces questionable incentives.  (Though to be fair, with proper allowance for downtime, the situation described is still the case in many traditional campaigns: wizards do research and enchanting and whatnot, and they go on occasional adventures mostly for treasure to fund their projects, or to retrieve rare components or tomes or whatever.)
  </p>
  <p>
    The 2nd edition of AD&amp;D primarily awarded XP for defeating monsters, but it also included an optional rule for “individual experience rewards”, including significant use of class abilities: warriors gain XP for defeating foes in combat, priests for casting spells to further their ethos, wizards for researching spells, etc.  This is not a bad idea, but like many things in 2e, the details were a bit cumbersome in practical application.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a similar vein, <em>Blades in the Dark</em> has several sources of XP, but one of them is overcoming obstacles using your class’s core skillset—e.g., a Lurk would gain XP for overcoming an obstacle using stealth or evasion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Games that do not use classes and levels have a bit more flexibility, as they can advance individual skills based on usage.  In <em>Mouse Guard</em>, for instance, you take note of each time your fail or succeed at using a skill.  Once you accrue a certain number of each, your rank in that skill increases.  (The number required for advancement increases as the skill rank does.)  Some other games, such as <em>Mythras</em> and <em>Burning Wheel</em>, have you simply mark a skill when you use it, then check after the session to see whether that skill increases.  If the style of the game is such that few checks are made in a typical session, this bookkeeping might be sufficiently modest to be practical.  This would be very difficult to apply in something more like a traditional D&amp;D game, however.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are considering implementing this to some extent, be careful that you do not accidentally undermine one of the core goals of a typical RPG, coöperation between players.  You probably don’t want players competing with each other for which treasure they get their hands on and which creatures they kill.  (Unless you do, in which case, carry on.)  This is why XP for treasure is usually evenly divided between everyone involved in retrieving said treasure, and XP for overcoming challenges is divided between everyone participating in that challenge.  (Well, more or less: 3e had a system for adjusting this for characters with different levels, so those at lower levels gain more XP; and if a particular character only <em>barely</em> participated in an encounter, it’s reasonable to reduce their XP reward.  But as a general principle, everyone should share.)  But XP for skill use is necessarily individual.  Again, in some games—particularly those more focused on story and with very few die rolls—this can work just fine.  But you probably don’t want a group of D&amp;D players tripping over themselves to see who can be the one to solve the problem at hand in every room of the dungeon.
  </p>

<h3 id="discoveries">Discoveries</h3>
  <p>
    If exploration and discovery are major themes in your game, you can award XP for that.  <em>Numenera</em>, for instance, explicitly rewards discovery, whether of a new artifact, or a place, important person, procedure, device, knowledge, abstract truth, or something about oneself.  In an old-school sandbox hexcrawl, you can award XP for each hex cleared, or whatever.
  </p>

<h3 id="character">Character development</h3>
  <p>
    Achieving character goals is an individual form of <a href="#milestones">story reward</a>; this section is more about the day-to-day of the character.  This can be a significant factor if the nature of the game is much more focused on character traits.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a couple of the ways you can earn XP in <em>Blades in the Dark</em> include if you expressed your character’s beliefs, drives, heritage, or background during the session; and if you struggled with issues from your vice or traumas.
  </p>
  <p>
    One GM ends each session in the Storytelling System by giving everyone a point for playing, then asking the players what they did to deserve more XP.  “What did they do that was important, how did they move the story forward, did they roleplay their concept, did their character develop in anyway?”  One benefit of this is incentivizing players to take notes and think in-character.  (A secondary benefit they’ve found is that the simple act of discussing the events of the session helps players to put things together that they didn’t notice at first; some time to reflect can be useful in games with mysteries!)
  </p>
  <p>
    If your “game” is centrally about playing a role, and less about playing a game, these could be useful approaches to investigate further.
  </p>

<h3 id="experiences">Experiences</h3>
  <p>
    Yes, I know, but hear me out.  In games built around the idea of “scenes”, it can be natural to use such scenes as the foundation for character advancement.  For example, one commenter speaks highly of the system used by <em>Cortex Prime</em>; as they described it,
  </p>
  <blockquote>
      Every scene is logged on your character sheet.  You can then use a callback to that scene to add to your dice pool where your prior experience may help your current test.  Or you can exchange one or more scenes for permanent improvements to your character.  When you do that, you can’t use the scene for callbacks anymore, because that experience is now “baked into” your character’s skills/<wbr>abilities/<wbr>traits.  It is a very elegant system that is easy to manage and plan for as a GM.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    If that sounds like too much to track or too fiddly to implement, I imagine you could simply mark the scenes as XP; this might work particularly well in a game like the Story* Systems, where each character might earn 1 XP for each significant scene they were involved in.  Or, if you don’t want to track that and/or your group often splits up and you don’t want players to have to compete for the spotlight, perhaps just count up the number of significant scenes at the end of a session and hand that out to each player present.  Tweak the details to suit your group’s play style.
  </p>
  <p>
    This could even be shoehorned into a class-and-level system like D&amp;D, probably by treating scenes as small <a href="#milestones">milestones</a>.
