<h1>Advancement</h1>
<h2>What <em>are</em> XP, anyway?</h2>

<p>
  Experience points are often presented or even treated as if they were rewards, but this is dangerous.  It’s probably more useful to view them instead as a <em>pacing mechanism</em>.
</p>
<p>
  There are at least two reasons why it may be best not to treat XP as rewards.  One of these is the psychology of intrinsic vs. extrinsic rewards.  In some cases, consistently giving someone a reward for behavior they used to do for personal enjoyment can result in them losing enjoyment in the behavior as their motivation shifts to being external rather than internal.  If you immediately and directly reward the core mechanic of a game, that reward may become the reason for playing the game.
</p>
<p>
  A second reason is that you don’t want to motivate unhealthy competition between players, nor to cause frustration at inadequacy or resentment at favoritism, regardless of whether these are real or merely perceived.  It doesn’t take much thought to see why you shouldn’t give XP for out-of-character things like bringing food or writing a ten-page backstory; it’s a bit subtler, but there are similar reasons you shouldn’t give bonus XP to the best roleplayer or for the most clever ideas.  If you really want to reward individual actions that you find particularly cool, there are other kinds of small but useful “bennies” (Inspiration, Hero Points, Fate Points, FYIA Tokens, etc.) you can hand out without making a shy or less proficient player feel discouraged at falling behind in advancement.  Those are optional; XP are essential.
</p>
<p>
  And whether you try to treat it as a reward or not, it doesn’t change the fact that the fundamental purpose of XP is to govern the rate at which characters improve and develop, in an attempt to produce a near-optimal gameplay experience.  Assuming, of course, that this is even appropriate for your game.  Advancement might not be necessary or appropriate if you’re only playing through a single story, for instance, or if you’re playing characters who are already capable and experienced: at least one <em>Star Trek</em> RPG has an XP-like system that allows you to gradually <em>change</em> your character, but they rarely actually <em>improve</em>, and that fits the genre.  But many long-running campaigns feel more satisfying if PCs slowly grow in power, allowing them to tackle larger problems and face greater challenges.

  One commenter, who <a href="why.html">doesn’t use XP anymore for leveling up his players</a>, put it this way:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    For me, the reason to have levels is so that as a DM I can tell different aspects of the story.  Low level they’re fighting giant spiders and street thugs, high levels they’re still fighting giant spiders (because who doesn’t like spiders?) but they’re demonic spiders the size of a house.  Oh, and they may be fighting ancient dragons and the like.  It also gives a lot of people a sense of accomplishment and growth.  How awesome is it when you can finally cast fireball or blade barrier?
  </p>
  <p>
    Granting XP?  I guess you can use it to reward and encourage specific behavior.  But for me?  I don’t want to do that - I want people to do what they think their PC would do.  The options and the challenges I put out for them should be their own reward.  I run a very sandbox-style game, I don’t need nor do I want to have some meta-game influence to tell my players what they “should” do.  If they storm the castle, it should be because storming the castle makes sense, not because the castle has a lot of bad guys to kill and loads loot [<em>sic</em>].
  </p>
  <p>
    Another thing I hear is a sense of accomplishment.  But again, I want that sense of accomplishment to come from achieving goals in the game.  Saving the hamlet from the invading horde should be its own reward.
  </p>

  Some games openly acknowledge that XP are for pacing, granting a certain amount of XP per session played, or even per hour of real time spent playing the game.  Even those that try to pretend it’s a reward usually tie it to the core gameplay activity, making sure that once you’ve played the “real” game long enough, you advance.  In the earliest editions of D&amp;D, most of your XP came from the value of the treasure you recovered, making it very clear what those games were about.  In later editions, the primary source of XP shifted to defeating adversaries, then to overcoming challenges in general.  But even then, the DMGs for the modern (WotC) editions make it very clear that the math is based on an expectation of the players having a certain number of encounters per level.  (The 3e DMG explains that the math was built for 13.33 standard encounters per level—a hilarious amount of precision that was typical of that edition—but also gives advice for faster or slower rates of advancement, as well as for awarding XP in a quicker and more free-form fashion.  The 4e and 5e DMGs have similar advice and heuristics, and also suggestions for how to handle advancement <a href="why.html">without using XP at all</a>.)
</p>
<p>
  Once we view XP in this way, many things become much simpler.  The extraordinarily cumbersome XP calculations of 3e are plainly revealed as excessively complex, those of other editions of D&amp;D and other games counting XP in the thousands are clearly more fine-grained than is necessary or useful, and you are freed from the worries of trying to ensure that the precise number of XP you are awarding is neither more nor less than what each player or PC has actually “earned”, because as long as the overall pace is about right, everything will be fine.
</p>
<p>
  In summary, you can save yourself a lot of trouble and create a more enjoyable experience for your players if you view XP as a pacing mechanism, and not as an actual reward in the usual sense.
