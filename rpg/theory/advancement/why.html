<h1>Advancement</h1>
<h2>To XP, or not to XP?</h2>

<p>
  You may not have much choice as to whether to use XP in your game.  In some games, XP are just baked too deeply into the system to easily extricate.  It’s probably <em>possible</em>, of course, but it’s doubtful whether it’s worth it.  For example, in many skill- or point-based games (such as the Story* Systems), XP are spent directly by players to improve their characters’ abilities.  In AD&amp;D, different classes have different rates of advancement, and your ability scores affect your XP earnings.  In the 3rd edition of D&amp;D, multiclassing can impose XP penalties, and XP are also consumed to craft magic items or cast powerful spells.
</p>
<p>
  If the game you’re playing has such strong ties to a specific XP system (and you don’t feel up to the massive task of designing an alternative), you can either award XP according to the rules or guidelines established by that game, or do so based on simpler criteria that work out to roughly the same <a href="what.html">pace</a>.  For example, the 3e DMG has guidelines for how to award XP based on a holistic assessment of encounter difficulty (skipping most of the math), as well as for awarding XP just based on sessions and/or stories (skipping almost all of the math).  Some of those ideas could probably be backported to AD&amp;D with very little work.  In a classic World of Darkness Storyteller System game, instead of awarding 1–5 points per session based on a checklist of criteria like roleplaying and heroism, you might instead award, say, 1 XP per major scene—or even more simply, a few XP per session, depending on what you feel is the most appropriate pace.
</p>
<p>
  On the other end of the spectrum, some games don’t have a place for XP at all, using other mechanisms to govern advancement.  In <em>Burning Wheel</em>, for instance, you mark a skill when you use it, and after the session, you make a test to see if it advances.  In <em>Mouse Guard</em>, you track your successes and failures with each skill, and once you’ve reached the requisite number, your rating improves.  If your game has a system like that, it’s probably best not to mess with it too much unless you feel a specific need.
</p>
<p>
  However, many level-based games, including the 4th and 5th editions of D&amp;D, use XP in ways that allow much more freedom.  Both of those editions’ DMGs provide options and advice for adjusting the pace of the game, awarding XP with less math and bookkeeping, and even handling advancement without using XP at all.  Since each class uses the same table for advancement, no game mechanics provide bonuses or penalties to the rate of XP gain, and XP is not spent as a <a href="resource.html">consumable resource</a>, the points themselves don’t actually matter—only the levels do.  If you’re playing one of these or another game with similar characteristics, you have more options available to you.  You can certainly use the standard rules as written, but if you find those to be cumbersome (as many do), there are various ways to simplify advancement.
</p>
<p>
  The most drastic simplification is to do away with XP altogether and use other means to determine when PCs advance a level.  In the most rules-light and freeform version, the DM simply instructs the PCs to advance a level whenever it feels like they’ve been at their current level for long enough.  (This is sometimes called “leveling by fiat”.)  Some groups even report success allowing the <em>players</em> to decide by majority vote when to level up.  If the campaign has clear chapters or arcs in its story, or if players regularly achieve significant milestones such as completing major quests or defeating “bosses”, those can often make good points for advancement. (For more on this, see my discussion of <a href="sources.html#milestones">milestone-based advancement</a>.)  Regardless of the precise approach taken, when handled well, this allows a group to advance at the pace that is most appropriate for them—allowing enough time to become acquainted with their characters’ new abilities, but not lingering for so long that they feel bored or restless at the stagnation.  In games focused more on storytelling and roleplaying, players and GMs alike can find XP to be an annoying intrusion; if you’d rather do away with it, you certainly can.  (One commenter pointed out that there’s an additional benefit to ditching XP, which is eliminating certain types of meta-level thinking and discussion, especially the problem of, “I’m 10 XP from leveling, so I go out and hunt down an orc.”)
</p>
<p>
  However, there are reasons you might still opt to use some sort of XP-based system, albeit possibly simplified somewhat.  For one thing, if you’re relatively new to a game system and you’d like to have a bit more guidance on what constitutes an appropriate amount of time between levels, it can be comforting to have something to actually track.  That’s a perfectly good reason to put up with a modest amount of bookkeeping.
</p>
<p>
  Also, awarding levels without XP generally assumes and requires that all PCs are always at the same level as each other.  This is usually fine if you have a group that is mostly stable and consistent, or at least a central storyline in which if a new character joins, they should come in at the same level as the rest of the group.  However, if the group composition or individual achievements can vary significantly (such as in a West Marches–style game), different characters may have different experiences and advance at different rates.  In that case, you’ll probably <em>want</em> to use some sort of XP system to keep track of who should level when.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, some players become very frustrated if they don’t have a clear, seemingly “objective” measure of their progress toward their next level.  Such feelings are not uncommon, and they are perfectly valid.  Even Sage LaTorra expressed frustration with “milestone XP”; in a conversation about this on Twitter, he said,
    “I just found that they didn’t reinforce anything I did in the game.  They felt like I was along for a ride and someone would hand out my next level when they felt like it.”
  Particularly if you are intending a long-running campaign, it might be wise to take your players’ feelings and preferences on this point into consideration.
</p>
<p>
  If you are inclined to use XP in your game, consider how it should be <a href="sources.html">earned</a> and <a href="calculations.html">calculated</a> to best suit the style of your game and your preferred level of complexity.  But if you don’t see a compelling reason to use it, and it sounds like more hassle than it’s worth, and your players don’t care, you can just ignore it!
