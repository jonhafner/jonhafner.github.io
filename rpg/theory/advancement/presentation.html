<h1>Advancement</h1>
<h2>Presentation</h2>

<p>
  Alright, so you’ve settled on a method of advancement.  How much information do you give to your players?
</p>
<p>
  You might not have much of a choice in the matter.  For instance, if you’re playing a system that uses XP as a resource (SS, 3e D&amp;D, <em>Numenera</em>, etc.), your players need to know how many points they currently have so they can make decisions about when and how to spend it.  Or if you’re playing a game with a very clear and rigid XP system, like AD&amp;D, and you insist on doing it strictly by the books, there’s probably no reason to hide their XP totals.
</p>
<p>
  On the other end of the spectrum, if you aren’t using XP at all, there might not be much <em>to</em> tell the players.  If you level them up after every major quest achieved or big boss defeated, there are few mysteries.  (If they vote on when to level up themselves, there are even fewer mysteries.)
</p>
<p>
  But there’s some space in the middle where you might want to consider being a little more secretive.  If the players always know exactly what their current XP total is and how many more are needed to level up, that can sometimes lead to some narratively unsatisfying outcomes.  Let’s consider a few examples of possible scenarios that can arise if players always know their exact XP totals:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Suppose they’re exploring a dungeon, and after another fairly standard encounter, they reach the XP total they need to level up.  Some players might be tempted to go back to town so they can rest up and gain their level, then return to resume their dungeon delving.  Never mind that it doesn’t make sense from the <em>characters’</em> perspectives—if they’re not running low on resources, why leave now, and give the dungeon time to change?  It’s a very metagame decision, and worse, one based on incomplete information.  As GM, I might even feel motivated (especially looking at the prospect of all of the work needed to figure out how the dungeon changes in reaction to their actions) to reveal some metagame information myself, with a sigh and a facepalm: “Guys, there are only two more rooms, and nothing deadly.  Just finish the fucking dungeon.”  Feels kinda bad, doesn’t it?  If they didn’t know they’d reached the next level threshold, there wouldn’t have been a problem.  Yes, they’d level up slightly later, but they’re still earning XP in the meantime; this doesn’t delay future levels at all.  The overall pacing would be much better.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Conversely, suppose the party only gets two or three rooms <em>into</em> a dungeon when they hit their next level threshold.  They don’t have much invested yet, so unless there’s some sort of goal with time pressure, why not bail, go back to town, rest long enough to level up, then return to take on the dungeon at greater strength?  This makes even less sense from the characters’ perspective, though at least now the GM might have more success talking them out of it by pointing out that when the denizens discover their slaughtered allies, they’re going to take extra precautions and beef up their defenses in prepration for future incursons….
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Suppose the party has a climactic battle against a major villain: the PCs suffer lots of damage, maybe one or two fall unconscious, the casters burn through all their spells, everybody is using up magic items and attempting desperate maneuvers, and finally, through tremendous effort and no small amount of luck, they squeeze out a victory!  One that, when everything is tallied up, brings them … just shy of the next level.  That <em>suuuuuucks.</em>  The most narratively satisfying thing to do here would be to go ahead and give them that level anyway—but if the players <em>know</em> they’re not there yet, that level gain might feel cheap and unearned, even though it’s really anything but.  If you as GM have kept XP totals private, you can merely omit that fact, congratulate the players on their victory, instruct them to level up, and everybody feels great.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In all three of these cases—<em>especially</em> the third—keeping XP totals secret to allow some adjustment to the timing of levels has the potential to provide a more enjoyable play experience for the players and GM alike.
</p>
<p>
  Such an approach combines some of the strengths and weaknesses of your chosen XP system with those of milestone advancement.  It has the advantage of being more “rigorous” than milestones, giving you more guidance on appropriate pacing.  However, it does risk some types of players becoming dissatisfied with the uncertainty from the lack of a concrete measure of progress.  It’s a good option to consider if you like the idea of milestones but want more structure, as long as your players are okay with it.
