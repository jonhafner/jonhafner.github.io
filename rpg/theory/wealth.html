<h2><a name="systems">Systems</a></h2>

<p>A question often raised (as of this writing, most recently in a Reddit thread and the <em>Haste</em> podcast) is that of how much detail is necessary in tracking characters’ wealth, and how to handle any abstractions you may desire.  At one end of the spectrum, a traditional low-level dungeon crawl might require taking note of every copper piece; at the other end, some systems are all about the story, and the question of what you can afford is all about what is most sensible and/or interesting.  (Most games are somewhere in between.  For example, in <em>Rogue Trader</em>, you own a starship the size of a city; it almost doesn’t even make sense to ask how much it costs you to buy a clip of ammo for your rifle, but that doesn’t mean you can just up and buy a second ship.  This is handled via a mechanic called Profit Factor.)</p>

<p>Several options at various points along that spectrum are presented here.  Some game systems may themselves impose inherent restrictions on what range of abstraction is feasible, but for the most part, you should be free to choose a wealth system that best fits the style of your campaign.  In making this choice, though, do not neglect the preferences of the players!  You don’t want to force excessive bookkeeping if nobody cares, but nor do you want to prevent someone from being frugal and saving up for a special purchase if that’s what they want to do.  Some negotiation and compromise may be necessary.</p>

<p>[Several games were mentioned in the discussion as having interesting or useful wealth / economy / resource systems; however, most of these are games I do not currently have ready access to, so I don’t know yet what merits they may have.  These include Rogue Trader, Shaintar, Mutants and Masterminds, Burning Wheel, and Fantasy Craft.  If these are ever obtained, consider incorporating what I learn into this document.]</p>



<h3><a name="full-accounting">Full Accounting</a></h3>

<p>At this level, every last cent, copper, or credit is noted and accounted for.  This method is probably suitable only for cases when the characters are severely strapped for cash, either because they were just robbed (or otherwise do not have access to their usual resources), or because they’re just starting out in a game that involves acquisition of wealth as a goal (such as beginning characters in a <em>D&amp;D</em> or <em>Shadowrun</em> game).  However, as PC wealth increases, it’s probably best to move to some form of Partial Accounting before long.</p>



<h3><a name="partial-accounting">Partial Accounting</a></h3>

<p>In Partial Accounting, money is still used and accounted for, but transactions below a certain threshold are ignored.  (This is somewhat akin to how the IRS allows you to round to the nearest dollar, and they themselves ignore debts or refunds of less than a dollar.  Or, perhaps more appropriately, consider that most restaurants do not charge for water, and that much of what’s available on the Internet is considered “free” even though there are costs involved in electricity and data transmission.  In an industrialized society, the costs of such things can easily drop below the cost involved in accounting for them.)</p>

<p>To illustrate, consider a traditional <em>D&amp;D</em> game.  Beginning characters might have to pinch coppers, but before long, a typical excursion into a dungeon brings in a haul comparable to what a commoner earns in a year.  At that point, the smallest coins become more of a nuisance than anything.  By unanimous decision, the group (including the DM) can decide to, say, hand-wave anything that costs less than a silver piece.  (The decision to go this route is required to be unanimous so that a player who really enjoys this aspect of the game isn’t robbed of their fun.)  Not long after that, you can ignore small expenses less than a gold piece.  Eventually, anything less than platinum won’t be worth bothering with, and so on.  As long as the DM keeps a watchful eye to prevent abuse, this should work very well.  (The most obvious type of abuse would be purchasing large quantities of cheap things, but of course those would be combined and the total assessed as a whole.  Other issues could arise if characters somehow end up with vastly disparate levels of wealth, but even that is not an insurmountable obstacle.)</p>

<p>Some games systematize this into a Lifestyle (see <a href="#app-lifestyles">the <em>Shadowrun</em> appendix below</a>) or Upkeep (3e&nbsp;<em>DMG</em> pg&nbsp;142) mechanic to handle your regular living expenses, requiring purchases only for adventuring equipment and suchlike.  These systems have their advantages, and should be consulted for ideas, but they also have their disadvantages.  One of these is the coarse granularity; another is the difficulty of flexibility (such as allowing for nonstandard lifestyles or radically unbalanced priorities).  If a system like this is used, though, consider including at certain levels a line like, “Furthermore, ignore reasonable purchases below [blank], at the DM’s discretion.”</p>

<p>Better, in a game that uses Partial Accounting, I might instead suggest setting up monthly “budgets” for your expenses that are sufficiently consistent.  These may include lodgings, food, clothing, entertainment, drinking, or whatever else you regularly spend money on.  Just work out how much you spend on that category per month, based on quantity and quality, and treat any “normal” expenses of that type as simply being included in your budget.  This allows the flexibility to account for one character wanting to buy a keep and hire guards, another wanting to invest in farmland and workers to establish a steady source of income, and yet another constructing a solitary wizard’s tower.</p>



<h3><a name="resources">Resources</a></h3>

<p>Story-focused game systems like Fate and Storyteller (WoD, <em>Exalted</em>, etc.) often have a character trait that measures material resources and wealth in a vague fashion that nonetheless has a little bit of numerical and mechanical weight to it.  Some systems are more finely grained than others, but too fine of a granularity tends to be counterproductive in my opinion.  (See, for instance, the Wealth score of <em>d20 Modern</em>.  I read the entry in the SRD, and I was not impressed.  I really think that in a game like that, some form of Partial Accounting is the way to go.)</p>

<p>It’s surprisingly difficult to find actual rules in the WW books about how Resources is to actually be used, but it appears that it’s common to roll that score plus another trait to see if you can obtain the item or service in question.  (This other trait is probably Manipulation by default, but one can imagine cases in which another Attribute or even an Ability might be more appropriate.)  Now, if this is the extent of it, it opens itself up to the classic problems of a wizard with a lucky roll breaking down a door that just withstood the fighter; so, this mustn’t be the extent of it.  Probably best is to pay close attention to the descriptions attached to each level of Resources and use that as an aid in following the advice to do as much as possible without rolling.  Based on the character’s socioeconomic status, most purchases should either be trivial or impossible.  (“Oh, you’re middle-class?  Sure, you can pay for a taxi ride across town.  No, you can’t buy a helicopter.”)  Only the borderline cases would actually call for a roll, particularly if failure has interesting consequences.  (If failure doesn’t have interesting consequences, perhaps just give the player the option to pay with a temporary point of Resources, as described below, instead of calling for an actual roll.)</p>

<p>Fate Core does have some more detailed rules for using Resources (q.v.), but some people find them boring.  Ryan Macklin wrote an <a href="http://ryanmacklin.com/2014/02/one-rethinking-resources/">article</a> in which he proposes a rough sketch of an idea inspired by the old adage, “Fast, good, cheap: pick two.”  Basically, when the player makes a Resources roll against the target set by the GM, the result determines the outcome as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Success with style:</strong> you get fast, good, and cheap. Nice!</li>
<li><strong>Success/tie:</strong> you get two of those.</li>
<li><strong>Failure:</strong> you get one of those, which means it may be more of a liability than you’d like — effectively it’s success at a cost as default.</li>
<li><strong>Failure by 3 or more:</strong> it’s totally unavailable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fast means that you get it as quickly and easily as is plausible; otherwise, there is some sort of delay or hassle.  Good means that what you get is of good quality; otherwise, it has some potential flaw or issue, which the GM can invoke if (i.e., when) desired.  Cheap means that it doesn’t drain your resources; otherwise, it incurs a drain on your Resources score (as described in the rules).</p>

<p>Based on the result, the GM decides which of these are the case, though there may be some interplay.  In particular, if the item is Cheap, the player might choose to pay the “not cheap” cost anyway to obtain either Fast or Good—or both, by paying more.  Of course, this is entirely at the GM’s discretion: not all problems can be solved by throwing money at them.  Also, note that “The Resources roll tells you what’s available, but you can turn the deal down. (It’s possible that turning down a deal after a roll could have fictional consequences, like snubbing someone, but that’s for the story to play with.)”</p>

<p>Note also that this system (or one like it) could apply to other skills/traits as well, like Contacts.  (One commenter mentioned that they used something like this when the players called on an old acquaintance in the middle of the night for some emergency medical care.  Their roll was good but not great, so he rolled a die to pick between possible reactions from the NPC: “It’ll cost ya,” “What-ever” [contact is annoyed, and less coöperative next time], or “You owe me one.”  Similarly, you can use a die roll as the GM when trying to decide between Good, Fast, and Cheap, or whatever else.)</p>

<p>Another commenter proposed that instead of being flat-out unavailable, the total failure could instead mean a “pick 0” sort of situation—because, hell, sometimes you need a car, any car, no matter how shitty it is or how much it costs you.  One must be careful when considering allowing such things, though, because the Resource drain of “not cheap” needs to have some actual bite.</p>

<p>This even transfers over to the Storyteller system pretty well: When there’s uncertainty as to whether something is affordable (and failure has interesting consequences), the GM can simply have the player roll their Resources score (plus another appropriate trait) against an arbitrary difficulty based on how hard it feels like it should be for one of your means in those circumstances; for each success obtained, you get one of Fast, Good, or Cheap.  (In a newer Story* System in which the target number is always fixed, these could instead be represented by Complications: each of Not Good, Not Fast, and Not Cheap could be bought off with successes.)  If you take a deal that’s not Cheap, your Resources rating <em>temporarily</em> decreases by one point, to recover over time.  (This affects only your ability to make further Resources rolls; your permanent score is used for determining your standard of living, figuring out what’s reasonable, etc.)  As noted above, you can also pay for Good or Fast if the GM permits it, based on circumstances.  If you botch, the item is entirely unavailable.  (Depending on circumstances, you may have to pay the Not Cheap or Not Fast penalty in the process of finding this out.)  Furthermore, GM permitting, if your temporary Resources score is down to zero, you may continue to pay Not Cheap costs by spending <em>permanent</em> Resources dots!  This is harsh, but when the shit really hits the fan….</p>

<p>The rate at which temporarily spent Resource points regenerate could vary by circumstances, as logic and pacing demand: it could restore naturally over time from working a job or bringing in rent or investment income or whatever (at a rate determined by the GM), or it could be helped along more directly by looting a treasure, collecting a bounty, or selling a significant item.</p>

<p>A last note on interpretations of the fast/good/cheap interpretations: One way of interpreting “not fast”, if the delay is long enough, could be that the character has to save up to be able to afford it (or chooses to save up to afford it without strain, depending on whether or not they got “cheap”).  Another interpretation, taking it as “not easy”, might be that you drive a hard bargain while pissing off the shopkeeper.  This could of course be handled as purely RP consequences, but it could also be mechanical, such as suffering a higher difficulty when trying to buy similar items in the future.</p>



<h3><a name="story-driven">Story-Driven</a></h3>

<p>Of course, in some games, this may all be entirely moot.  Supposedly, <em>L5R</em> handles the issue by basically saying, “You’re samurai, you don’t pay for anything.”  Even if you don’t want to go that far, you can still avoid the issue by turning all nontrivial purchases into stories, if that’s the kind of game you want to run:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every time the PCs want to buy something, or are in debt, or need to pay a fine, turn that into a story.  If they need a suit of armor, let that session be an adventure for the purpose of getting a new suit of armor, maybe by doing a favor for the blacksmith or getting the aid of a wealthy sponsor or by earning the money themselves (and in the process uncovering a deeper story).  If they need to pay a fine, let them negotiate the fine instead, leading to a rich session full of role-playing.</p>

<p>Likewise, when they get rewards in dungeons and the like, instead of giving them “wealth”, give them an artifact with a legacy to be learned, or evidence for a plot to overthrow the king, or a book of arcane magic to be learned, or a golden ingot that (while valuable) would catch the eye of a historian studying a long-forgotten civilization.</p>

<p>Forget “wealth” altogether.</p>

<p>Start rewarding players with story or artifacts or questions – it’s way more interesting.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><a name="app-issues">Appendix: General Issues</a></h2>

<h3><a name="execution">Execution</a></h3>

<p>A common objection raised to abstracting wealth is the fear that it may cheapen the experience of finding treasure, but the proper way to handle the presentation of loot is actually independent of the underlying system:
<blockquote>
<p>And the correct answer to “What’s in the chest?” is not “+2 wealth,” and actually it’s not even “10,000&nbsp;gp, a silver necklace with a fist-sized ruby (1000&nbsp;gp), and a sapphire diadem (5000&nbsp;gp).”  The correct answer is: “As you open the chest you have to avert your eyes until they adjust to the radiance.  Some of the bright spots won’t stop dancing in front of your eyes, until you realize it’s actually a giant ruby hanging from a silver necklace and a big sapphire diadem, both sitting snugly on a comfy bed of shiny gold coins.”</p>

<p>What adventurer (no matter how seasoned) can count 10,000&nbsp;gp in the blink of an eye?</p>
</blockquote>
In a similar vein,
<blockquote>
<p>As a Fate RPG guy, +2 Wealth in aspects could be something like <em>Several Gold Ingots Stamped with an Ancient Insignia</em> or <em>The Necromancer’s Grimoire</em>.  The solution to this is not necessarily reverting to the time-consuming and über-crunchy numerical wealth system, but making the rewards more interesting by including story threads, plot hooks, non-wealth rewards, and so forth.</p>

<p>As a corollary, a really important one, wealth isn’t interesting because it’s valuable – but because it suggests an interesting and fun future: more money means more power.  But that’s usually it with a numerical system: wealth = power.</p>

<p>By switching to non-numerical rewards it might force one to start thinking about other interesting futures: I wonder how much the mages’ guild will pay us for this dusty tome?  What civilization crafted these ingots?  Can we even carry these back down the tunnel?</p>
</blockquote>
These are related to the general idea of how rewards don’t have to be strictly monetary: they could be things like magical items (especially consumables) or something like a voucher with a local craftsman, or whatever.  This is usually a supplement to a standard wealth system, but it could be the whole thing, especially in societies based on bartering and/or settings where magic is rare and mysterious and thus has no direct monetary value.</p>

<h3><a name="draining-wealth">Draining Wealth</a></h3>

<p>Of course, as characters’ means outstrip their needs, they need things to spend all this cash on.  Part of it goes to maintaining their lifestyle, of course.  (And if you want to make sure more of it does, use slower healing rules and enforce time requirements on things like training, research, crafting, etc.)</p>

<p>Also, when it comes to giving the players things to throw their money at, don’t forget paying bribes, making contacts, paying information brokers, buying rapid transportation, etc.  And then, of course, there’s more permanent property, like land, buildings, serfs….  (Note that the size and security of your residence governs how much stuff you can own beyond what you carry, as well as how safe it is.  Also, it’s not just fighters wanting keeps, but wizards could want libraries and workshops, clerics could build temples, and so on.  All of these probably have associated upkeep costs, so maybe invest in farmland or rental properties or something to establish steady income?)  And then there are public works projects, like erecting a monument in honor of those lost in some tragedy, or maybe if you contribute enough to the rebuilding of the orphanage, they’ll rename it after you…?  And of course, there are the various servants and hirelings.  (Cross-genre, but a thread about an online <em>Shadowrun</em> game suggested populating your home with “a loyal butler, a ‘main squeeze,’ a mage’s apprentice, a fun-loving roommate, a personal trainer, etc.”)</p>

<h3><a name="complications">Complications</a></h3>

<p>One commenter has a suggestion for what to do if a character depletes their resources too far in one of those abstract systems and needs a quick restoration: “Give them a ‘loan’ and bump it back up … but with consequences for non-repayment.  In real life, that’d be a terrible idea, but in roleplay?  That’s <em>adventure!</em>”</p>

<p>Also note that the black market tends to involve quite a lot of haggling and massively fluctuating prices; such deals should lean heavily on social rolls.</p>



<h2><a name="app-lifestyles">Appendix: <em>Shadowrun</em> Lifestyles</a></h2>

<p>The Lifestyle system used in <em>Shadowrun</em> was brought up a few times throughout the online discussions.  I believe I’ve found the relevant section from one of the rulebooks, but it was a poor copy-paste job on a campaign page on Obsidian Portal; I’ve edited it to the best of my ability, but I can make no claims as to its accuracy.  (I don’t even know which edition it’s from.)  Regardless, it seems to contain some very interesting ideas:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even though it may sometimes seem that many <em>Shadowrun</em> characters live in a bar or a rundown squat, each character actually has a unique lifestyle. Lifestyle measures the quality of a character’s daily life and her living expenses, including shelter, food, entertainment, clothing and so on. It does not cover technical resources, weapons, magical equipment, professional hirelings, or other major but not personal items. The player and the gamemaster can also decide on other interesting details of the character’s lifestyle, with almost infinite variations. For example, a character might live in an abandoned building, but install enough conveniences in it to qualify as having a Luxury lifestyle. Keeping all those gadgets running, buying security, maintaining water supplies, and keeping a low profile will cost her as much as a mansion in a ritzy neighborhood.</p>

<p>Players can choose from one of six lifestyles: Luxury, High, Middle, Low, Squatter, or Streets. They may also temporarily find themselves saddled with the Hospitalized lifestyle (see below). A character living a Middle or higher lifestyle can support guests at a rate of 10 percent above her own cost of living per guest. A host can also keep a guest at a lower lifestyle than her own by paying 10 percent of the cost of the guest’s lifestyle. Characters may only buy one lifestyle. This lifestyle truly reflects the runner’s standard living circumstances. Additional living amenities such as hotel stays, workshops, safehouses, and so on are handled as separate costs. Likewise, while lifestyle accounts for the costs of maintaining a vehicle (or paying for other methods of transportation), it does not account for the cost of a vehicle itself—that must be purchased separately.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Luxury</dt>
<dd>This lifestyle offers the best of everything: ritzy digs, lots of high-tech toys, the best food and drink, you name it. The character has a household staff, maid service, or sophisticated drones to do the chores. She gets by in her massive mansion, snazzy condo, or the penthouse suite in a top hotel. Home security is top-of-the-line, with well-trained guards, astral security, and quick response times. Her home entertainment system is better than that in public theaters and accessible from anywhere in the home. She’s on the VIP list at several exclusive restaurants and clubs, both real and virtual. This is the life for the high-stakes winners in the world of Shadowrun: high-level executives, government big shots, Yakuza bigwigs, and the few shadowrunners who pull off the big scores (and live to spend their pay).
<br><strong>Cost:</strong> 100,000¥ a month and up!</dd>
<dt>High</dt>
<dd>A High lifestyle offers a roomy house or condo, good food, and the technology that makes life easy. The character may not have the same perks as the really big boys, but neither does she have as many people gunning for her. Her home is in a secure zone or protected by good, solid bribes to the local police contractor and gang boss. She has a housekeeping service or enough tech to take care of most chores. This is the life for the well-to-do on either side of the law: mid-level managers, senior Mob bosses, and the like.
<br><strong>Cost:</strong> 10,000¥ a month</dd>
<dt>Middle</dt>
<dd>The Middle lifestyle offers a nice house or condo with lots of comforts. Characters with this lifestyle sometimes eat nutrisoy as well as higher priced natural food, but at least the autocook has a full suite of flavor faucets. This is the lifestyle of ordinary successful wage-earners or criminals.
<br><strong>Cost:</strong> 5,000¥ a month</dd>
<dt>Low</dt>
<dd>With this lifestyle, the character has an apartment, and nobody is likely to bother her much if she keeps the door bolted. She can count on regular meals; the nutrisoy may not taste great, but at least it’s hot. Power and water are available during assigned rationing periods. Security depends on how regular the payments to the local street gang are. Factory workers, petty crooks, and other folks stuck in a rut, just starting out, or down on their luck tend to have Low lifestyles.
<br><strong>Cost:</strong> 2,000¥ a month</dd>
<dt>Squatter</dt>
<dd>Life stinks for the squatter, and most of the time so does the character. She eats low-grade nutrisoy and yeast, adding flavors with an eyedropper. Her home is a squatted building, perhaps fixed up a bit, possibly even converted into barracks or divided into closet-sized rooms and shared with other squatters. Or maybe she just rents a coffin-sized sleep tank by the night. The only thing worse than the Squatter lifestyle is living on the streets.
<br><strong>Cost:</strong> 500¥ a month</dd>
<dt>Streets</dt>
<dd>The character lives on the streets—or in the sewers, steam tunnels, condemned buildings, or whatever temporary flop she can get. Food is wherever the character finds it, bathing is a thing of the past, and the character’s only security is what she creates for herself. This lifestyle is the bottom of the ladder, inhabited by down-and-outers of all stripes.
<br><strong>Cost:</strong> Hey pal, life ain’t all bad. It’s free.</dd>
<dt>Hospitalized</dt>
<dd>This special lifestyle applies only when a character is sick or injured. The character is confined to a hospital: a real one, a clinic equipped as a hospital or a private location with the necessary equipment. Characters cannot own this lifestyle. They only pay for it until they get well or go broke, whichever comes first.
<br><strong>Cost:</strong> 500¥ a day for basic care, 1,000¥ a day for intensive care</dd>
</dl>

<p><strong>Keeping Up the Payments</strong>
Characters must shell out nuyen each month to keep up a lifestyle. If they miss a payment, they may end up in debt and living a lower lifestyle. Each month that a character misses a payment, roll 1 die. If the result is greater than the number of consecutive months of payments missed, no sweat. The character’s credit (which is part of the cost of the lifestyle) absorbs the missed payment. If she makes the next payment, everything is fine. If the die roll result is less than or equal to the number of missed payments, the character is in trouble. Her lifestyle gets downgraded one level, which means being evicted from her former home, having some of her tech repossessed, having to hock some clothes, and so on. The character is also in debt, and owes somebody one month’s cost of her former lifestyle. If the character is mostly legit, she’s in debt to a credit company. If the character is a criminal or shadowrunner or is living a lifestyle lower than Middle, being in debt may mean that she has defaulted on less formal financial obligations. This situation can lead to earnest discussions with large persons on the subject of debt management. After the character gets out of the hospital, she can pay back the loan. If not, there’s always a good market for fresh body parts and used cyberware. “Taking it out of your hide” has a whole new meaning in the year 2070.</p>

<p><strong>Buying a Lifestyle</strong>
A character can permanently buy a given lifestyle by making a payment equal to 100 months’ upkeep. For example, ten million nuyen buys a permanent life of luxury. This sum represents investments, trust funds, and so on that take care of payments. Nothing in life is certain, however. A character can lose a permanent lifestyle through an enemy’s action or through sheer bad luck. A hacker can rip investments to shreds, or enemies can blow real estate holdings into scrap. These things depend on how the character’s story unfolds, not on how much is her bank account at the time.</p>

<p>If a player wishes, her character can sell a permanent lifestyle of Middle or better. If the character has a couple of months to broker a legitimate deal, roll 2D6. Multiply the result by 10 percent to determine how much of the purchase price the character gets paid for her “property.” If the character doesn’t have the SINner quality, roll only 1D6. Also roll 1D6 if the character must dump her home and possessions fast or through an agent because she is on the run.</p>

<p><strong>Team Lifestyles</strong>
If a team is particularly tight-knit and lives together (or if a few members of a team want to shack up), they can buy a joint team lifestyle. The cost is an extra 10% per extra person. If the team is purchasing a Low Lifestyle or higher, one member of the team will have to be the tenant of record. This is the one stuck with the debt if the team doesn’t keep up payments.
