<h1>“Bennies”</h1>

<p>
  The term seems to have been popularized by <em>Savage Worlds</em>, but it has been generalized to apply to nearly any kind of tokens or points that players can “spend” as a sort of meta-narrative currency to influence game-mechanical outcomes.  These can include most things called Hero Points, Action Points, or Luck Points, as well as Inspiration in 5e, Fortune in SotDL, Fate points in FATE, some uses of temporary Willpower points in the Story* Systems, immediate or short-term uses of XP in <em>Numenera</em>, etc.  Here, I explore various considerations related to such things.
</p>
<p>
  [Update: Shortly after I “finished” writing this document, I discovered a recent post by Jon Peterson at <em>Playing at the World</em>, <a href="http://playingattheworld.blogspot.com/2021/01/a-history-of-hero-points-fame-fortune.html">“A History of Hero Points: Fame, Fortune and Fate”</a>.  The history of such currencies goes back at least to 1978, when Fortune Points and Fame Points were proposed for <em>Top Secret</em>.  That post contains some interesting insight into their history, but it does not significantly affect my discussion below.]

<h2 id="quantity">Quantity</h2>
<p>
  Most of these systems can be sorted into one of two main types: a binary state or a number of points.  If it’s a binary state (like Inspiration or Fortune), you have it or you don’t: once you have it, you can’t get more until you spend it, and once you spend it, you have to wait some variable (possibly unknown) amount of time until you get it again.  If it uses tokens or a point rating, you can potentially have more than one at a time, whether because you started out with a pool of them, or because you can acquire more through play even if you already have some, or both.
</p>
<p>
  Both systems have their advantages:  The binary state can encourage players to use it, because they can’t get more unless they use what they have.  But that also encourages them to save it, because they only have one use of it right now, and who knows how long until they get another?  Allowing more than one can make it less painful to spend them, but if their replenishment is rare, that can also encourage hoarding.
</p>
<p>
  There are some systems that combine useful features of both of these in ways that I think are more useful.  They generally involve pools of points that replenish at a rate that is at least somewhat predictable.
</p>
<p>
  For example, in SS, Willpower has a maximum value, and you automatically recover one each night (which means after a story, if your character has several days of downtime, you’ll be replenished to full anyway).  This allows you to be a bit more casual with spending Willpower points, since you usually have more than one and you know you’ll be able to gain more on a regular schedule.  It also encourages you to actively look for occasions to spend them because any time you would regain Willpower but you’re already at max, you have, in some sense, “wasted” a potential point.  (That doesn’t mean you should always exhaust your pool entirely; there’s no harm in keeping a point or two in reserve in case you need it.  But if you’re almost always at full, you’re probably failing to make good use of the resources available to you.)
</p>
<p>
  A simpler system is to just give each player a certain number of tokens at the beginning of each game session, but that do not persist between sessions.  The appropriate number could depend on the length of a typical session, the mood of the game (how heroic or epic should it be?), the power level of the PCs (more powerful characters could reasonably be expected to meet with greater success), etc.  It’s up to the players to decide <em>when</em> to use them, but the fact that they can’t “save” them for next time should nudge the players to spend them more readily.
</p>
<p>
  There’s another possible mechanic for games with levels but no trait that provides an obvious cap:  For something like D&amp;D, perhaps at the start of level X, your current Hero Point total is increased to X.  (If it’s above X, it doesn’t change.)  If you have unspent points when you gain a level, you’ve essentially wasted them!  So over the course of each level, you should try to use them up at appropriate times.  Note also that with this system, the higher your level, the more crazy shit you can do.  (I don’t recall where I got this idea, but it was probably inspired by the “bankable” <a href="#FYIA">FYIA tokens</a>, but modified to discourage hoarding.)
</p>

<h2 id="use">Use</h2>
<p>
  So, once you have some points or tokens or whatever, what can you <em>do</em> with them?
</p>
<p>
  In 5e, if you have Inspiration, you can spend it before making a d20 roll to gain advantage (or cancel out disadvantage).  This is elegant in some ways—it’s certainly simple—but it has lots of issues.  One problem is that, as I’ve discussed elsewhere, the A/D system feels out of place to me in D&amp;D; it serves the goal of bounded accuracy, but if that’s not one of your design goals, it’s not so great in general.  Another problem is that it has to be declared before you roll, so it can feel like it was wasted (especially if you roll really high, but not 20, on both dice).  It can also be a real bummer if you forget about it in your excitement as you prepare to roll; many players often don’t even <em>think</em> about it until after they roll and see they’ve failed, before they’re like, “Oh, wait!  But I have Inspiration!” only to have the DM dash their hopes.  So lame.  (Hell, sometimes the player has forgotten entirely, and it’s only while they’re wallowing in their failure that another player is like, “Wait, didn’t you have Inspiration?”  Sad times.)  Some DMs will allow the player to spend it anyway, allowing them to just go ahead and roll a second d20—effectively, turning it into an after-the-fact reroll mechanic, which is probably how it <em>should</em> have been written in the first place.  (Or at least as an option: you should still be able to spend it before a roll to cancel out disadvantage, if you would like.)
</p>
<p>
  SotDL’s Fortune mechanic allows you to turn a failure on a d20 roll of yours into a success, or grant two boons to another player’s roll, or replace the number on any one d6 with a 6.  This feels better than Inspiration, and it’s more flexible, but it’s also more complicated.  FYIA tokens have assorted effects, but these can mostly be summarized to moving the result of any d20 roll one step up or down between failure, success, or critical success, or maximizing or minimizing any damage roll.  Willpower gives you one success (which might get canceled out by a 1, but it can still smooth out a botch).  A Fate point can either give you a +2 to your result or allow you to reroll the entire pool (your choice).  These are of greatly varying power.
</p>
<p>
  The options that allow you to turn a failure into a success are simple, straightforward, and satisfying: there’s no chance for it to be “wasted”.  If you fail, you spend a Point, and now you’ve succeeded.  Fantastic.  On the other hand, being able to turn a failure into a success automatically can be pretty powerful if you’re fighting something that you have to roll, say, a natural 19 just to even hit.  Maybe some concessions need to be made; perhaps spending a Point just gets you a small or medium bonus on a roll.  But then, how much?  And doesn’t it suck when you still miss by, say, only 1?
</p>
<p>
  Another option could be to instead rely on rerolls:  After any die is rolled, but before the consequences are put into place, you can force a reroll of that die by spending a Point.  You miss an attack roll?  You can spend a Point to try again.  Still a miss?  Spend another Point if you want, and have it to spare.  An enemy hits you?  Make <em>them</em> reroll.  Connect with your battleaxe but roll a 1 on your d12 for damage?  Spend a Point and roll that fucker again!  (In most games, it should be an explicit part of the social contract that if a roll affects another player more than it affects you, you should get that player’s permission before forcing a reroll, unless they’re, like, attacking your character, or something.  In other words, don’t use this to be a dick.)  I think this is somewhere in the appropriate middle ground of power: it’s pretty good at helping you succeed on easy rolls that you missed by a fluke, but it’s unlikely to help with long shots, so you’d only want to use it for those in a moment of true desperation—and if it works, that’s quite a dramatic payoff!
</p>
<p>
  (Also note that this can replace or supplement the Willpower mechanic in WoD: You can still spend a point of Willpower for a single success if you just want a no-risk simple success, but the primary usage might be what I introduced above: reroll any one die.  Particularly handy if you get a 1: with no other successes, even if you get an ordinary failure on the reroll, you’ve at least avoided a botch.  Or if you do have other successes, if you can change that to a simple failure, your net successes go up by 1, and if you turn it into a success, you’ve gained a net of 2!  Again, you can spend as many points as you want to make that roll as good as you need.)
</p>
<p>
  Of course, there is a major downside to the reroll-based uses, and that is the nontrivial possibility of wasting your scare resource.  Imagine you’re making an important but not terribly difficult check—you only need a 3 or better to succeed.  You roll a 2, so you spend a Point, roll again … and get a 1!  Very few people would find that fun.
</p>
<p>
  Even though it’s a bit fiddly, probably the best thing to do is to stick with the modest but reliable option: shift the outcome by one “step”, whatever that means, within the bounds of the dice.  So, for example, on a d20 check that’s binary pass-fail, if a 1 would be a failure and a 20 a success, you can spend a Point to turn one result into the other.  With a non-binary spectrum, you can spend a Point to scoot the outcome by one step (critical failure ↔ failure ↔ success ↔ critical success), so long as it’s possible to turn the die to a number that would achieve that result.  (That condition means that you cannot exceed the bounds on the absolute best or worst possible results.)  You could also maximize or minimize any damage roll.  In a dice-pool system, each Point you spend can increase or decrease the number of rolled successes (or complications) by 1, again, so long as you could change a die to achieve that result.  (By “any roll”, I really mean any roll made by that player, made on behalf of that player’s character, or made <em>against</em> that player’s character.  No meddling in the affairs of other PCs!)
</p>

<h2 id="acquisition">Acquisition</h2>
<p>
  The systems described above in which Points are awarded or replenished automatically according to some method are adequate, but it’s nice if there’s some other way to get these as well.  A common approach is to award them for “good roleplaying”, but we have to be <em>very</em> careful what we mean by that.
</p>
<p>
  Awarding a Point for a clever idea is not great, for a few reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Having a clever idea is usually its own reward, as it helps solve a problem, or at least makes the game more fun as you <em>attempt</em> to solve the problem.  Furthermore, some research suggests that providing an extrinsic reward can <em>replace</em> the intrinsic reward, thereby making the activity less enjoyable.
  </li>
  <li>
    Not every player is clever!  (I’m certainly not.)  If one player is really good at outside-the-box lateral thinking, they’re going to sweep up these rewards, and other players may become resentful.  Worse, some might <em>try too hard</em> to be “clever”, and make the game less fun for themselves and/or the other players as a result.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some players might not want to work that hard; this is a game, after all, and we’re adults with jobs.  Maybe they just want to sit down, roll some dice, and have fun with their friends.  Are you going to assert that they’re having the wrong kind of fun?
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Awarding a Point for good acting (solid character voicework, moving emotional speeches, etc.) suffers from very similar problems.  Similarly for awarding a Point for pulling off a remarkable stunt: doing so is generally its own reward, and it doesn’t make sense for every character to take insane risks.  These are all suggestions offered by many rulebooks and articles for various game systems, but they are all poor design.
  <!-- [Core to helping me realize this were some remarks made by Matt Colville; see my notes on his video v315182200 for more details and discussion.] -->
</p>
<p>
  What about out-of-game things, like being the mapmaker, or writing session summaries, or providing snacks, or whatever?  No, not that, either.  Not for snacks, because that amounts to bribery.  As great as it might sound at first, you really don’t want the players competing over who can bribe you with the tastiest treats game after game.  That way lies rivalry and resentment.  You also don’t want to try to bribe them to do things like drawing maps or writing flash-fiction, because again, that’s a thing that only some players are interested in, and you don’t want to turn intrinsic rewards extrinsic.  In one campaign I ran, one of my players added in-character journal entries to our wiki because he wanted to, not because I bribed him to!  I don’t remember if I offered rewards for that or not (at the time, I was experimenting with handing out +1 tokens for various things), but if I did, it sure didn’t convince the other players to do anything toward that.
</p>
<p>
  So, what <em>should</em> be rewarded?  Well, how about good roleplaying?  But wait, you might be asking, isn’t that what I just rejected?  No.  Roleplaying is not the same as acting, nor does it have anything to do with cleverness or luck.  Roleplaying is about making decisions motivated by thinking of your character as a <em>person</em> rather than a set of numbers on a page.  The core idea is perhaps best expressed by this thought I had for how to introduce this mechanic to new players (or at least new to my game):  Assume that tokens have been distributed and explained; if someone asks how they earn more, delay until later.  If somebody takes an action (perhaps after uncertain deliberation) that is in-character but suboptimal, discuss briefly with the table to make sure everyone agrees that this doesn’t really hurt them, and does in fact make the game more interesting and fun.  If so, flip the player a token, and say, “<em>That</em> is how you earn more tokens, because that’s the core of roleplaying: making decisions based on <em>character</em>, not calculation.”
</p>
<p>
  So, that’s basically it.  In the Storyteller System, you could regain Willpower by doing a thing specified in your chosen Nature.  In 5e, you can gain Inspiration by playing into your character’s Flaw.  In FATE, you can earn a Fate point by accepting a compel.  Etc.  The language used in the FATE CORE book in the section on Compels is particularly useful:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Anyone at the table is free to suggest when a compel might be appropriate for any character (including their own).  GMs, you have the final word on whether or not a compel is valid.  And speak up if you see that a compel happened naturally as a result of play, but no fate points were awarded.
</blockquote>
<p>
  That last part is especially useful, because it relieves the DM from the stress of constantly monitoring for when it’s appropriate to award Points, and of doing so consistently and fairly.  They already have plenty else on their mind, thank you.  (Even Mike Mearls, a lead designer of 5e, admitted to being the kind of DM who always forgets to reward Inspiration, so he removed this task from his plate when running a prelude adventure to the Temple of Elemental Evil; see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aB24yj2mvQ">the session recording</a>, around 6 minutes in, where he explains that he gave each player a brief mission and a list of three goals specific to their character: when they achieve one, they can check it off and give themselves Inspiration.  Some might argue that such things warrant individual XP rewards instead, but regardless, the point is that it’s hard to remember to do this stuff as a DM!)
</p>
<p>
  You might object that this is tying an extrinsic motivation to roleplaying, with possible negative consequences.  However, I think we can get around those problems:  Don’t frame the bonus token as a “reward”—frame it as <em>compensation</em>.  This is a player choosing a mechanically suboptimal path for the sake of staying true to their character.  They’re already paying a cost; I don’t think it does harm to lessen that cost with a consolation prize.
</p>
<p>
  So, my current thinking is that the systems described in “Quantity” are likely to be the <em>primary</em> sources of Points, to relieve some of the stress from the DM and to help the players feel more confident in a predictable payoff schedule.  But it is nice if there’s a way to earn more of them by embracing the core precept of the medium of tabletop roleplaying.
</p>

<h3 id="flaws">Flaws</h3>
<p>
  Some game systems allow characters to take Flaws or Disadvantages in exchange for more character points to spend elsewhere (or, in the case of at least one set of optional rules somewhere in 3e, to gain an Advantage or extra feat or something).  However, these are notorious for being min-maxed, with players routinely taking Flaws that either don’t really impact their character build or would be conveniently “forgotten” during the game.  At least one game system, though, had Flaws/Disadvantages actually <em>cost</em> character creation points, since they were a way to generate some sort of mechanical benefit!
</p>
<p>
  So perhaps take a middle ground, in a way that also relieves you of a great deal of game design work, and provide a list of Flaws that are simply examples of traits you might give your character—at no immediate cost or gain—that could give you opportunities to earn Points during the game when they create significant complications or hardships for you.  (This is still at the GM’s discretion, so if you choose, say, a flaw that could come up in every single scene, expect rewards to quickly taper off until only the new and interesting hardships are rewarded.  These are not machines where you can keep pushing a button and popping out a Point each time; their purpose is to make the game more interesting, not annoying.)
</p>
<p>
  (Side note: I think I’m also proposing this as a replacement of the Story* System’s Flaws!  Instead of granting Freebie Points, they could be a source of Willpower or bonus XP, depending on their nature and implementation.  How much you get out of them depends not on some theoretical calculation of their point value, but rather on how much trouble they actually create for you during the game.)
</p>
<p>
  It bears stressing that of course, flaws aren’t the only path to getting extra Points.  Playing into other aspects of your character’s nature (such as their alignment or Nature), background, even their strengths could potentially earn Points—any time you make the interesting but suboptimal choice.  This doesn’t require much skill or talent or extroversion, simply an understanding of and commitment to your character, along with the basic social awareness to make sure that it’s making the game fun for everybody, not making them hate you just a little bit more.
</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>
  The “rule” (guideline) is that making an interesting (not disruptive) choice because it’s what your character would do, even though it is mechanically disadvantageous, may warrant a reward of a Point.  Don’t rely on the DM to notice and remember: they may be too engaged in how cool this moment is to think about it!  Feel free to bring it up yourself—and also feel free to raise the issue if you see another player do something like this.  And above all, have fun!
</p>

<h2 id="FYIA">Appendix: FYIA Tokens</h2>
<p>
  One of my earlier encounters with this idea was in 2007 or 2008, when I found an article from the <em>Deeper in the Game</em> blog, <a href="https://bankuei.wordpress.com/2007/08/01/dds-fyia-tokens/">“D&amp;D’s FYIA Tokens”</a> (2007 Aug&nbsp;1).  The post wasn’t too long, I’ve pasted it below in case it disappears, edited lightly for mechanics.  It’s a valuable source of inspiration, but I do have thoughts on refinement, as discussed throughout the document above.  (And if you need something more friendly to mixed company, you can always call them “Awesome Points” or something.)
</p>
<blockquote cite="https://bankuei.wordpress.com/2007/08/01/dds-fyia-tokens/">
  <p>Last year at GenCon, Shannon brought up a frustration about the D20 rules where her uber-monk wasn’t allowed to do what she had designed it to do—all over some arcane technicality rule that prevents critical hits if you move beyond a certain distance (don’t ask me, it was REALLY ARCANE).  Mike Sugarbaker brought up the idea that D&amp;D should include, “Fuck You, I’m Awesome!” tokens, where you spend one, tell off the GM and get to bend or break the rules.</p>
  <p>It’s stuck in my head as probably one of the biggest missing bits to the game, even through all of its modifications and evolutions post 3.0.  Though certainly we’ve seen the addition of Action Points, and such, they’re still not really in line with the basic principle of value to rarity—you only get a handful per level, and they’re kind of tame for what they do.</p>
  <p>FYIA Tokens, instead, need to kick ass.  They need to be something you’d desperately want, and use in a game.  And you need to get enough to make it worthwhile.</p>
  <p><strong>So, here’s how they work:</strong></p>
  <p>You get 2 Free Tokens per game session.  You can spend these on your PC anytime, but you can’t save them between sessions.  They pretty much exist for you to spend willy-nilly each session.</p>
  <p>You get 1 Bankable Token per level of your character, each time you level up.  (1 Bankable at 1st level, +2 Bankable at 2nd, +3 Bankable at 3rd, etc.)  As you  might surmise, they’re something you can save between sessions, and over time.</p>
  <p><strong>What FYIA Tokens do </strong>(yes, you can spend more than one at a time to get multiple effects)</p>
  <p>Spend 1 to:</p>
  <p>- Turn any roll from a failure to a success</p>
  <p>- Turn any success into a 20 or an auto confirmed critical hit</p>
  <p>- Maximize any damage roll (magic or melee)</p>
  <p>- Minimize any damage roll received (magic or melee)</p>
  <p>- Cause an enemy to automatically fail Spell Resistance</p>
  <p>- Cause an enemy to automatically fail a Saving Throw</p>
  <p><strong>Strategies and effects on play:</strong></p>
  <p>So what does this all mean?  Well, they’re useful for both combat heads and spellcasters.  Obviously this means a party becomes tougher, probably at least one CR better in terms of overall encounters.  Mages can execute “Save or Die” spells easier, fighters can pull a guaranteed critical once a game, or a maximized critical, etc.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, even if you tend to roll unlucky or have a crappy character build, you do get to be awesome at least once a session.  Smart players will stick to just using the 2 Freebies every session and building up the Bankable Tokens for a really tough fight.  Other players will burn out their Bankables really quick, but at least be able to do something neat every session anyway.</p>
  <p>As characters rise in levels, they get more Bankable Tokens and get more dangerous overall.  (A maximized critical hit from a raging 20th level Barbarian tricked out on weapons and feats is a lot worse than a maximized critical hit from a 3rd level Barbarian.  And they get a LOT more tokens, meaning you’ll be seeing multiple hits in a really tough fight.)</p>
  <p>On the other hand, Bankable Tokens, once spent, are gone, so characters can shine really awesome in bursts, or all out at one time.</p>
  <p>You’ll notice that these rules work well regardless of if you’re playing D20 3.5 or 1st edition.  That’s intentional.</p>
  <p>So, next time you go off on a dragon, maximizing your spell damage or pulling a critical on it, screaming, “Fuck you I’m awesome!”, thank Shannon and Mike for the good idea.</p>
