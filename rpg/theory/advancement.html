<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
  <p>
    At least at the moment, this document is primarily concerned with advancement and XP (experience points) in level-based games like D&amp;D.  Systems like FATE, Cypher, the Story* Systems, etc. operate very differently; I have some thoughts about those scattered about here and there and also <a href="#nolevels">tucked into the end</a>, but they are not the focus here.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, this deals mainly with the question of how to decide <em>when</em> a character should advance, not with the mechanics of doing so; there’s little mention of training, for instance.  See the various editions’ DMGs for guidance on that issue.
  </p>



<h2 id="why">Why use XP, and what are the alternatives?</h2>
  <p>
    First, let’s talk about why someone might <em>not</em> want to use XP, and what the alternatives are.  Many DMs find XP excessively tedious to calculate and cumbersome to track and account for, so they try to find ways to either simplify it or avoid it entirely.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ditching XP altogether results in an approach sometimes called “leveling by fiat”.  There are several variations; in the most rules-light and freeform, you as the DM can simply have the PCs advance a level whenever it feels like they’ve been at their current level for long enough.  Some groups even have success allowing the <em>players</em> to decide by majority vote when to level up.
  </p>
  <p>
    If that sounds strange, it’s because it’s rarely used, and that’s because it doesn’t usually work well.  (The chunkiest form of milestone-based advancement sometimes looks very similar to this, however; <a href="#milestones">see below</a>.)  Whether they voice their opinions or not, most players become very frustrated if they have no idea how close they are to gaining their next level.  Arbitrary advancement is often a recipe for disaster.  Often, but not always: some combinations of players and campaign styles work just fine with this.  Whatever works for your group and supports everyone’s fun is permissible.  Just be aware of some of the dangers of taking this approach.  Unless your group is clearly on board with it, you might want to take a more systematic approach.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, in short, the prevailing advice for most games is to use some sort of XP system.  If the thought of this fills you with dread, fear not!  There are plenty of options that are much simpler, faster, and easier than those which are commonly published as the “standard” for D&amp;D and similar games.  Read on, and choose one that works well with your personal sensibilities.
  </p>



<h2 id="sources">Sources of XP</h2>
  <p>
    Once you’ve decided to award XP, you must then decide <em>for what</em> to award it.  There are many options, and most have advantages and disadvantages.  When choosing between them, consider not only how you feel about their mechanics, but also about what sort of player behavior the system incentivizes, as well as what implications it has for how your game world functions, if that’s something you care about.  For example, many early games, including Arneson’s <em>Blackmoor</em>, awarded XP for characters doing things that improved their skills—for practice, basically.  So, a fighter got better at fighting by defeating opponents.  This meant, though, that a wizard was best off spending his time in his library or laboratory, not out risking his life in dungeons.  This is a good simulation, but it does introduce questionable incentives.  (Though to be fair, with proper allowance for downtime, the situation described is still the case in many traditional campaigns: the wizard does research and enchanting and whatnot, and goes on occasional adventures mostly for treasure or rare components or tomes or whatever.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Ultimately, you can—and probably should—award XP for whatever behavior you want to encourage.  If you want a game about looting and pillaging, <a href="#treasure">award XP for treasure found</a>; if you want a game about exploration, award XP for each hex cleared, or whatever.  (<em>Numenera</em>, for instance, explicitly rewards discovery, whether of a new artifact, or a place, important person, procedure, device, knowledge, abstract truth, or something about oneself.)  If you have a clear vision, don’t overcomplicate things.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also note that not most of these methods are not mutually exclusive; for example, the 3e DMG includes guidelines for cutting encounter XP in half and allocating the rest to story rewards.  Myriad combinations are possible.
  </p>

  <h3 id="sessions">Play sessions</h3>
    <p>
      One of the simplest ways to track progress toward advancement is to simply count sessions of play.  For example, the 5e DMG says, “A good rate of session-based advancement is to have characters reach 2nd level after the first session of play, 3rd level after another session, and 4th level after two more sessions.  Then spend two or three sessions for each subsequent level.  This rate mirrors the standard rate of advancement, assuming sessions are about four hours long.”  Recall that the 5e experience table rushes the first few levels pretty quickly; you might need to adjust the pace for your game and group.  For a typical game, two or three sessions per level is probably about right.
    </p>
    <p>
      This method is easy, but it fails to account for many practical realities.  Have you ever had a group of players spend two hours spinning their wheels on a puzzle in a dungeon?  Or spend an entire session just going shopping and chatting with locals in town?  And then the same group can turn around and slaughter a dozen goblins, stop an evil ritual, uncover lost secrets, and return the blacksmith’s daughter safe and sound, all in a single session.  If you adapt their pace based on what they actually accomplish, you need to establish criteria by which to do so, and at that point, you’re basically reinventing another XP system.  Furthermore, your players are likely to become frustrated by not knowing how close they are to their next level.  On the other hand, if you always award levels after the same number of sessions no matter what, players will notice, and they’ll start to feel like it doesn’t actually matter what they do, since they’ll level up all the same anyway.  Alternatively, they may start to intentionally stall, dragging their feet in real-world play time to get a new level shortly <em>before</em> that big boss fight they know is coming up, for instance.  This is probably not desirable behavior.
    </p>

  <h3 id="milestones">Milestones and story rewards</h3>
    <p>
      Significant achievements can count as “milestones” toward advancement.  At one extreme, you can consider only truly major milestones, and let each one account for one (or more) levels.  With this approach, you will typically instruct players to level up after completing a major quest or other significant achievement, or at the conclusion of a “chapter” of the story; these are generally the most dramatically satisfying times.  Alternatively, the choice may be driven by the story in other ways, with the DM awarding levels as needed to ensure that the players are prepared for the upcoming challenges planned.
    </p>
    <p>
      This probably works best if you have a rough plot worked out for your campaign, broken up into arcs or chapters; it makes a great deal of sense to use these to guide the pace of leveling up the PCs.  (Some call this “leveling at the speed of plot”.)  Not only is it convenient, but it can actually create a situation where the mechanics reinforce the story: the sudden increase in personal power or introduction of new abilities coincides with the narrative growth of the character as they move into a new chapter, in more ways than one.  For example, in the first campaign of <em>The Adventure Zone</em>, the DM had the players gain <em>two</em> levels after each story arc was complete, before sending them out on their next mission.  Even setting aside concerns for the listener, leveling up in the middle of a mission would disrupt the narrative flow and perhaps complicate episode scheduling.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the structure of your campaign does not lend itself to such an approach (or if your players are frustrated by not having a clear, concrete measure of their progress toward their next level), you might find it easier to use smaller, more granular milestones: accomplishing a goal, discovering something important, reaching an important destination, etc.  You can decide on the number of milestones needed to progress, or you can tack them onto an existing XP-based system; the 5e DMG assumes the latter, advising you to “treat a major milestone as a hard encounter and a minor milestone as an easy encounter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, in Professor Dungeon Master’s system, as described in his Dungeon Craft video
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oju4v_yUrpc">D&amp;D XP the Fast &amp; Easy Way!</a>,
      roughly half the XP the PCs earn come from “achieving scenario objectives”.  (The other half come from his assessment of the difficulty of the challenges they face each session.  In his system, it takes 10XP to gain a level.)  Examples of 1-point scenario objectives from his current campaign include getting the owlbear head for the innkeeper, or retrieving the witch’s elven boots from the owlbear den; locating and liberating a group of prisoners or stopping the cultists from summoning a demon that’ll destroy the entire town might be worth 2 points each.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also make milestones very fine-grained, and even personalized; 2e, for instance, describes individual rewards for characters based on their classes, like a fighter defeating a foe in single combat, a wizard using a spell to solve a problem in a clever way, or a thief using their special skills in useful ways.  In a more story-based game, it would make sense to grant individual XP awards for completing personal goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      This system can feel very natural and satisfying; it avoids the tedious bookkeeping of tracking each individual encounter, instead awarding XP at times that feel narratively appropriate.  However, you do have some decisions to make regarding the relative value of the milestones:  Are all milestones equal, or are some more valuable than others?  Is the value of a milestone based on its narrative or psychological significance, or on the difficulty of achieving it?  What if the players achieve a major milestone very quickly and easily, whether through cleverness or sheer luck?  Is it still worth its full amount?  Are you rewarding XP solely for the end results, or should they represent the character actually <em>learning</em> something, ideally through adversity?
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, consider the possible degenerate case of a party who completes small tasks, gets into fights, discovers some interesting information or items, but for whatever reason, never manages to successfuly complete any of the quests or goals set as milestones.  Do they never advance, then?  Can they get “stuck” if they aren’t able to progress?  Or what if they decide they want to do things that matter to them, rather than follow the story you’ve laid out for them?  Are you prepared to adapt accordingly?  If not, you should ensure that expectations are clearly discussed before play begins!  Also, are you sure you can clearly identify coherent milestones?  This might not be hard if you have a plot prepared, but what about a large dungeon crawl, or a sandbox campaign?  If you scatter small milestones throughout, can you be sure that the players will complete them at a reasonable pace, or might they get clumped together, or skipped entirely?  Milestone advancement is very popular among DMs seeking to avoid messing with traditional XP, but make sure you have a clear understanding of how it will operate in your campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to avoid these problems but you’re having trouble letting go of “story rewards”, keep in mind that most of them already carry their own rewards, and need no further incentives:  If you complete a quest for someone, they presumably will compensate you with payment or some other reward they have promised you.  If you do good things without payment, that tends to yield other benefits, perhaps in the longer term.  (For example, doing something to help some poor sod leaves that person indebted to you; also, they are likely to spread word of your greatness, which improves your reputation, brings you to the attention of more powerful patrons, etc.)  If you achieve a personal goal, well, that’s something you’ve gained right there, assuming the goal actually meant something and wasn’t completely arbitrary.  You don’t really need more XP for such things.
    </p>

  <h3 id="treasure">Treasure</h3>
    <p>
      Quite famously, 1e awarded 1XP for each gp worth of treasure you found, recovered, and spent.  This synergized with the core goals of the game: find treasure and use it.  If this is what your game is about, it’s still a good system, as it clearly incentivizes players to obtain their goal as efficiently as possible; if you can use skill or trickery to avoid a fight, so much the better!  As one observer (possibly DM David?) remarked, “Players joke that D&amp;D is about killing things and taking their stuff, but in the original game, you were better off using your wits to take stuff.  So long as your cunning led to gold, you got experience.”
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if you try this now, you might have some rescaling work to do.  Early level advancement charts were approximately exponential—which makes sense when the rewards are fixed rather than relative—so that leads to the twin problems of explaining the incredible vastness of monster hoards (and dealing with the subsequent devestation to local economies wrought by its recovery), and also trying to find something for players to do with all that treasure!  To siphon some of this off, Gygax introduced high training costs for advancing levels, and even taxes; aside from being tedious and boring, the latter is also absurd.  As DM David <a href="https://dmdavid.com/tag/dungeons-dragons-stopped-giving-xp-for-gold-but-the-insane-economy-remains/">said</a>, “Gary spent a page arguing that taxes add <em>realism</em>, forgetting that no sensible tax collector targets a powerful band of killers, especially if they sometimes prove useful finding missing heirs, thwarting attempts to summon demon gods, and whatnot.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reason to avoid this method is that treasure is fundamentally its own reward.  Some characters want it for its own sake, but even those not motivated by greed have reason to seek out valuables:  Everyone needs food and lodging and equipment, and any surplus can be used to purchase better equipment, a stronghold, reputation, and so on; building a temple, raising an army, establishing a spy network, whatever.  And we haven’t even mentioned the immediate usefulness of magic items.  There’s probably no need to double down on this incentive!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you <em>do</em> want to make treasure the primary reward mechanism, you can simply drop XP altogether, instead setting costs for training to the next level.  Individual players can then choose how to spend their treasure to increase their power: by training up their personal power, or by paying for hirelings, magic items, or other resources.  (This abstractly reflects the 3e notion of paying XP for creating magic items or casting permanent spells; in earlier and later editions, these costs were measured in gold instead of experience.  They should cost <em>something</em>, but it doesn’t much matter what!)  There is another serious problem with this, though, and that is the difficulty it creates for certain character concepts, such as a traveling monk with a vow of poverty.  Do they still need to pillage loot to pay for training to advance in levels?  That feels weird.  That doesn’t mean this is a bad idea, just that it only makes sense for a <em>very specific kind</em> of campaign, and everyone needs to be on board with that.
    </p>

  <h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
    <p>
      We finally turn to the elephant in the room: XP for combat.  A known problem with this is the way it encourages the wanton slaughter of everything you encounter, without seeking more elegant solutions.  Yet it’s hard to discard out of hand something that has been the primary source of XP in almost every edition of D&amp;D.  Indeed, before we discount it, we should examine it more closely, and perhaps realize that the idea of awarding XP for combat is actually a kind of shorthand for awarding XP for <em>overcoming challenges</em>.  After all, the WotC editions of the game have applied the rules for assigning XP to monsters and NPCs also to traps, hazards, and skill challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this broadening of the concept to considering challenges in general, let’s ask ourselves what XP actually <em>mean</em>.  They’re a measure of a character’s <em>experience</em>, right?  Points you receive for <em>having experiences</em>.  (It’s right there in the name.)  And you learn the most from things that challenge you, right?  If you only ever do things that are easy, you won’t really improve much.  So, defeating (not necessarily killing) a foe in combat, or getting past a dangerous trap, or successfully navigating a tense negotiation … all of these carry risks, and avoiding the negative consequences requires some combination of skill, luck, and cleverness.  Or, maybe you don’t avoid the consequences, but you survive anyway; “The greatest teacher, failure is.”  (Some game systems award XP precisely when you fail a roll, making this explicit.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The key to making this work without overtly encouraging murderhoboism is to interpret “challenge” broadly as anything that carries a risk of failure, with consequences for failing.  Tricking a guard into leaving their post, sneaking past a sentry, or negotiating a trade deal with a dwarf lord could all count as overcoming challenges.  Professor Dungeon Master <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oju4v_yUrpc">describes</a> challenges as obstacles, giving examples of a menacing ogre, a scheming politician, or a trapped room.  In discussions of <em>Dungeon Crawl Classics</em> (DCC), at least one GM interpreted “encounters” as including dealing with a tight-lipped sage, or getting the right people drunk.  Someone else mentioned diplomatic negotiations, racing through the city to catch a fleeing burglar, or several days of overland travel to find a hidden cave.  “If it was tricky and took some work on the players’ parts, or cost the characters something in terms of possessions or abilities or the like, it’s probably worth some XP.”
    </p>
    <p>
      If you take this approach, it’s worth stressing to players that under this system, XP is awarded for surviving encounters, <em>not</em> only for killing monsters!  Be smart.  The 4e DMG describes how characters earn XP for “overcoming encounters”, which can include disabling or disarming a trap, successfully completing a skill challenge, and of course tricking, sneaking past, or defeating a monster.  Forgetting this can easily lead to the kind of bloody-minded play that is stereotypical of the game, and that risk is probably the greatest disadvantage of the system; however, when handled well, it has the advantage of promoting what’s probably the most iconic and expected form of the core experience.
    </p>



<h2 id="calculating">Calculating XP awards and setting advancement scales</h2>

  <h3 id="fixed">Fixed rewards</h3>
    <p>
      Most editions of D&amp;D (with 3e being the primary exception) assign an XP value to each thing the players are expected earn XP for (whether that’s treasure or challenges); the group of PCs involved in retrieving a treasure or defeating a monster or whatever divide the XP evenly among themselves.  As characters’ XP totals reach the thresholds given in the relevant table, they gain levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the TSR editions, level thresholds are approximately exponential (at least for about the first ten levels or so); in 4e and 5e, they are closer to polynomial.  The XP values of creatures are then derived from this somehow.  Unfortunately, none of these systems are entirely regular or transparent.  This isn’t surprising in the older editions, since they are thoroughly quirky, but the regression exhibited by 4e and 5e following the regularity of 3e is frustrating.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to use something that is similar to this in spirit but easy to calculate, you can try the “regularized exponential scale” I developed, which I’ll include below.  Beware, however, that this merely simplifies the scales; it does nothing to address the underlying problem of the false accuracy of calculated CRs.  Advance assessment of a challenge is always imprecise at best.
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary>Regularized exponential scale</summary>
      <p>
        Combining the quasi-exponential advancement of the TSR editions with the fixed XP of the non-3e editions, but with 3e pacing, assume a typical level has a little over ten level-appropriate challenges, so a CR&nbsp;<em>X</em> challenge should supply each character with a little under 1/10 the XP a Level&nbsp;<em>X</em> character needs to advance to level <em>X</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.  Assuming a typical party size of four PCs, that means a little under 4/10 that XP.  Use a simple exponential progression; for example:
      </p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Level</th><th>XP</th><th>XP to next</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>0</td>     <td style="text-align:right">0</td>   <td style="text-align:right">500</td></tr>
          <tr><td>A</td>   <td style="text-align:right">500</td>   <td style="text-align:right">500</td></tr>
          <tr><td>1</td> <td style="text-align:right">1,000</td> <td style="text-align:right">1,000</td></tr>
          <tr><td>2</td> <td style="text-align:right">2,000</td> <td style="text-align:right">2,000</td></tr>
          <tr><td>3</td> <td style="text-align:right">4,000</td> <td style="text-align:right">4,000</td></tr>
          <tr><td>4</td> <td style="text-align:right">8,000</td> <td style="text-align:right">8,000</td></tr>
          <tr><td>5</td><td style="text-align:right">16,000</td><td style="text-align:right">16,000</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        Etc.  (We bake zero- and apprentice-level into the system to make the progression work more smoothly, since by starting at a nonzero XP total, you can simply double the XP for the current level to get the next.  Otherwise, the first two level gains are the same, which throws off the XP-by-CR calculations.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we calculate the value of a CR 1 challenge: A 1st-level adventurer needs 1,000XP to advance to the next level, so a party of four of them requires 4,000XP.  A single CR 1 challenge, then, should supply a little under 400XP.  Wanting a multiple of 60 (for divisibility reasons), that suggests 360.  Similar calculations for higher CRs (and simple division for fractional ones) yield something like the following chart:
      </p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>CR</th><th>XP</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>1/4</td>   <td style="text-align:right">90</td></tr>
          <tr><td>1/3</td>  <td style="text-align:right">120</td></tr>
          <tr><td>1/2</td>  <td style="text-align:right">180</td></tr>
          <tr> <td>1</td>   <td style="text-align:right">360</td></tr>
          <tr> <td>2</td>   <td style="text-align:right">720</td></tr>
          <tr> <td>3</td> <td style="text-align:right">1,440</td></tr>
          <tr> <td>4</td> <td style="text-align:right">2,880</td></tr>
          <tr> <td>5</td> <td style="text-align:right">5,760</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        Etc.
      </p>
    </details>

  <h3 id="3e">Third Edition</h3>
    <p>
      Like many parts of 3e, the experience point scale is a very regular system that captures many of the most useful features of the TSR editions.  The first innovation, and most obvious, is to put every class on the same advancement scale.  This is huge, and while the numbers have changed through the editions, the fact of a unified progression has stuck.  Second, the scale itself consists entirely of nice clean multiples of 1,000 according to an obvious, simple formula, with a quadratic progression.  This allows us to have something that <em>feels</em> classic, in the sense that the numbers are in the thousands and grow ever larger, but is much more stable and predictable, while also not growing out of control, reaching absurd values in the tens of millions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, this clean regularity in the scale comes at a cost.  This edition introduces the notion of Challenge Rating (CR) as a rough measure of the difficulty of a creature or other obstacle relative to a typical PC.  There are guidelines for how to estimate CR and instructions for how to compare that to a character’s level to determine the corresponding XP reward.  This is much more transparent than the TSR approach.  Unfortunately, it’s also terribly cumbersome.  Even if you stick to published challenges with CRs already given, you still have to consult a large table and do some division to find out how much XP to award your players—and if some PCs have different levels than others, they will receive different amounts of XP from the same encounter!
    </p>
    <p>
      The real problem here is the nonlinear progression, presumably retained as a “sacred cow” (or perhaps merely for its psychological impact).  It seems at first like a nonlinear scale is needed to moderate the pace of advancement; this is true with fixed rewards, but since rewards in 3e are calculated based on relative challenge, this is not the case.  Everything is based around the standard difficulty.  From the 3.5 DMG: “An encounter with an Encounter Level (EL) equal to the PCs’ level is one that should expend about 20% of their resources—hit points, spells, magic item uses, and so on.  This means, on average, that after about four encounters of the party’s level the PCs need to rest, heal, and regain spells.  A fifth encounter would probably wipe them out.”  As for the pacing, the “Behind the Curtain: Experience Points” sidebar includes the paragraph, “Thirteen or fourteen encounters can seem to go by very quickly.  This is particularly true at low levels, where most of the encounters that characters take part in are appropriate for their levels.  At higher levels, the PCs face a varied range of Encounter Levels (more lower than higher, if they’re to survive) and thus gain levels somewhat more slowly.  Higher-level characters also tend to spend more and more time interacting with each other and with NPCs, which results in fewer XP over time.”  This makes it clear that you don’t need to change the scale in order to slow down advancement; basing XP rewards on relative difficulty will take care of the pacing on its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, there’s the currently accepted wisdom that the entire CR system itself gives a false sense of accuracy, when in fact, it’s only ever a crude estimate.  Even in the 3.5 DMG, there’s an entire subsection on the “Difficulty” of encounters that details various ways encounters can be harder or easier than the numbers suggest, often depending on circumstances and party composition.  4e is very tightly balanced, so its CR measures are more precise (though still not perfect); 5e returns to being notoriously unreliable.  CR might be a useful aid for encounter design, but relying on it too heavily for any purpose is dangerous.
    </p>

  <h3 id="Pathfinder"><em>Pathfinder</em></h3>
    <p>
      I assume the first edition worked more or less like 3.5.  The second edition (PF2) uses a simple 1,000XP-per-level advancement; this has advantages, like being easy to tweak the rate of progress (just change that number), easy to gauge progress (500XP? halfway to the next level), and easy to set ad hoc non-combat rewards without consulting a chart.  Presumably, it does something 3e-like with adjusting XP based on CR, but I don’t know the details of that system; in any case, I’m unlikely to be fond of it.  If you’re going to be so precise with XP, I much prefer the systems of both earlier and later editions where a given monster or trap or whatever could have a fixed XP value.  Otherwise, you can gauge challenges more holistically, but that demands “chunkier” XP and smaller totals.  Speaking of which, let’s move on to
    </p>

  <h3 id="DCC"><em>Dungeon Crawl Classics</em></h3>
    <p>
      As far as I can tell, all the systems mentioned so far start with a scale and then work out how much each encounter is worth based on that.  DCC seems to go in the other direction: Establish a system for assigning a value to an encounter, then set the scale as required to obtain the desired rate of advancement.  In so doing, it also gives us much smaller and simpler numbers to work with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most distinctive characteristic of the DCC XP system is that XP is awarded based not on the <em>expected</em> difficulty of an encounter, but rather on how it <em>actually plays out</em>.  Successfully surviving encounters earns XP, from 0 to 4 depending on difficulty.  A standard encounter, in which “characters incurred damage and were required to utilize resources to survive the encounter”, is worth 2XP.  A lesser threat is worth 1XP, while something that poses no significant threat is not worth any XP.  Conversely, a more serious challenge is worth 3XP, while 4XP would be awarded for “An extremely difficult encounter, one that the party barely survives.  Multiple character fatalities, significant character damage, and potentially a retreat of some kind required.”  (One person described how they assigned XP for the various encounters in a short adventure they wrote: traps were worth 2XP if defeated or bypassed, or 1XP to survivors otherwise; a minor puzzle or mystery granted 1XP if solved; most monsters were 2XP, but the major battle at the end would be worth 2–4XP, depending on how it shook out.)  It’s worth stressing that encounters go beyond merely monsters and traps; see the discussion above about basing XP on challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      For another example of awarding XP by relative difficulty, one GM said, “Just last week my players made a deadly encounter easy and happened upon a normal encounter that was way past deadly.  Darkmantle ambushes turn out to be pretty difficult to deal with, especially when they wake you from your sleep.”  Again, “easy” creatures can be used in challenging ways!  (Remember Tucker’s Kobolds, or whatever they were called.)  And defeating a “tough” monster because circumstances were in your favor isn’t much of an achievement.  Do remember to reward cleverness, though.  If an encounter <em>really should’ve</em> been challenging, and the party survived it through cleverness rather than force, don’t cheat them out of XP.
    </p>
    <p>
      This might seem all very arbitrary, but remember that CR calculations merely give the <em>illusion</em> of precision!  Actual challenge depends strongly on circumstances, like the environment, the PC party composition, the tactical acumen of the GM and players, etc.  Not to mention the difficulty of handling the nonlinear scaling of large numbers of low-CR baddies.  Awarding XP post hoc based on actual at-the-table difficulty actually makes way more sense.  At least one D&amp;D edition’s DMG even states or implies that CR can and should be adjusted to account for other circumstances.  At that point, why keep using CR at all?  (Except perhaps as a rough guide for adventure design, of course.  Monster indices by CR can be useful when populating tables of random encounters, or to let you know that a particular creature needs to be seriously beefed up or stripped down to be a reasonable threat for your players.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this sort of implicitly handles the matter of scaling rewards for large or small groups in a natural way: With old, fixed-XP methods, you divide the XP total evenly among the PCs, so the larger the party, the less each character earns.  This makes sense, as more characters usually make the encounter easier.  Smaller parties get larger XP rewards per person.  Well, under the DCC system, if you have so many party members that it makes the encounter easier than it should be, everybody gets fewer XP than standard, and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      One big caution if you’re going to adopt this method is that you’ll probably want to take note of the XP value of each encounter as soon as possible after it concludes, before you forget how it went.  (This is <em>especially</em> true if you assign different amounts to different PCs, as suggested below.)  You could even award XP immediately after the encounter concludes, though that could interrupt the flow of play; do what feels right for your table.  (You can still require downtime for leveling, so don’t worry about the problems of going up a level in the middle of a dungeon.)
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the progression scale, DCC uses a quadratic progression, just as 3e does, though the details differ.  It varies by edition (beta vs final, and perhaps more variants exist), but one chart I saw put 1st level at 10XP, 2nd at 50XP, 3rd at 110XP, 4th at 190XP, and so on, with the gaps continuing to increase by 20 XP per level.  (Recall that in DCC, each player typically starts out with two to four zero-level characters; generally, any that survive the “funnel” make it to first level.)  Unfortunately, that scale makes advancement very rapidly slow down to a crawl.  (Advancing from 1st to 2nd level requires twenty standard encounters; advancing from 3rd to 4th requires forty of them!)  This is probably intentional, given the old-school, lower-powered grittiness of DCC, but you might want to tweak the scale if adapting it to a different style of game.  (See my general conclusion below, where I integrate this with another system to create something that I think is smoother, simpler, and more natural.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I suppose I should discuss the possibilities of not awarding equal XP to all PCs.  If some were challenged more than others, the amounts could potentially vary.  (I don’t know whether this is mentioned in the published DCC material—as far as I know, it’s just something I thought of myself, although there is precedent in 3e in the case of PCs of different levels.)  There are a few ways this could be used; the most obvious is when there’s a clear power differential between characters, so that some are genuinely at greater risk and expending more resources than others.  This would have to be something more significant than normal asymmetries within a party:  If the cleric didn’t take a scratch, but had to use up all his spell slots to heal the front-line fighters, he has still spent personal resources.  If the rogue keeps to the shadows and backstabs things to death, she’s still risking great harm, since if she were to flub a Stealth check, she would likely get pummeled.  However, if some characters are having to burn through limited resources and/or suffer great harm or risk while other characters breeze right through, perhaps different XP awards are justified.  Perhaps this happens because of significant gaps in levels, or perhaps it’s because some characters are just better than others, due to skillful builds, good luck on rolled ability scores, or strong synergies.  (A druid or ranger is likely to have a much better time than a streetwise rogue in a campaign centered deep in the forest.)  This isn’t intended as some sort of punishment for being effective, mind you—it’s to reflect the fact that you don’t learn as much from things that are too easy for you!  Less effective characters learn more from their struggling, and giving them a boost to advancement can help level the playing field between players, hopefully helping everyone have more fun.  The more effective characters can always shoulder a larger burden of risk, evening out the challenge experienced.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Side note: I’m not suggesting automatically awarding extra XP to a character who has fewer than the rest of the party; if the difference in challenge is negligible, so too should be the difference in reward.  Small differences between levels are normal and not bad.  Differences large enough to challenge the characters differently can lead to unequal awards, as the characters learn different amounts.  But if the lower-level character is so far behind that they’re having to hang back and stay out of combat, they’ll actually learn (and earn) <em>less</em> from the experience, and probably shouldn’t be there at all; maybe they should do some solo adventuring, or group up with some other low-level characters to do things more level-appropriate?]
    </p>
    <p>
      Another place unequal awards might be warranted are cases where some characters take on more risk than others.  This should be rare, but if, say, one character hides out of sight and harm’s way for most of the encounter, they should probably get little or no experience for it.  Again, this should only rarely be applied: a cleric or wizard who hangs back and casts is still consuming resources in the form of spell slots, and a rogue who sneaks around the battlefield is still taking a risk of being seen and splattered.  I’m not talking about penalizing those who play intelligently—I’m talking about penalizing those who play cowardly, or who simply don’t participate for whatever reason.  This could even be due to inability: those who are incapacitated don’t traditionally get a share of the XP for an encounter, for instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case, if you award XP unequally, you should strongly consider doing so immediately after the encounter, both so you don’t forget and so players get immediate feedback and understanding of why this is the case.  You don’t want somebody to be surprised by getting fewer XP at the end of the night.

  <h3 id="ProfDM">Professor Dungeon Master</h3>
    <p>
      Professor Dungeon Master awards XP through a
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oju4v_yUrpc">system</a>
      that resembles a combination of story rewards/<wbr>milestones and the DCC criteria, except applied at the level of the play session instead of the encounter.  Each PC gets 1–5XP per session (typically 4).  For advancement, he uses a simple scale of 10XP per level.  When you advance to the next level, you reset your XP to 0 and only track your progress toward the next level—no charts needed!  He also points out how easily you can modify that number if you want faster or slower advancement.
    </p>



<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
  <p>
    So, this finally brings us around to my current leanings, which is to award XP by the DCC system, but instead of consulting a chart for progression, use the regularity of Professor Dungeon Master’s system, but rescaled: since a standard challenge is worth 2XP, we should double the level requirements to 20 instead of 10, except for the steps from 0th to Apprentice to 1st.  This brings it into line with the 4e and 5e standard of ten standard encounters per level, and close to the 3e standard of a little over thirteen per level.  (See the discussion of the 3e system, and specifically the citations from the 3.5 DMG, to see why advancement should slow down over time even with a linear scale.)

<h2 id="apprentice">A note on apprentice levels</h2>
  <p>
    I’ve mentioned apprentice-level characters more than once, which might seem strange, since I’m clearly of the opinion that their obvious use-case, of someone who wants to have two classes from the start, is best handled via a custom class.  Well, for one thing, why not let the player multiclass, if that’s what they really want to do?  But more importantly, an apprentice-level system is extremely useful when a character switches to a new class mid-career (like 2e’s dual-classing), or if you want to start with zero-level characters who <em>become</em> “real adventurers” through play.  In both cases, an apprentice level, if handled well, can be a useful on-ramp to smooth things out a little bit and ease the transition in a logical fashion.  (Like, you go from no spellcasting ability at all to having several cantrips and a couple first-level spells?  What?)
  </p>
  <p>
    I don’t need to fret about that right now; I can hold off until it’s needed.  Some rules will be obvious: you’ll count as zero- or half-level in the class, you’ll get half your hp but not yet a full HD, extrapolate spellcasting tables back one level, etc.  For BAB and saves, use the fractional multiclassing tables and roll those back one level also.  That should cover most of the core rules, then you’ll just need a little bit more for individual classes.  (Do apprentice fighters start with proficiencies with all simple weapons, light and medium armor, and non-tower shields, and maybe a very small number of martial weapons, then get the rest of the proficiencies at 1st level?  Do apprentice rogues get half of their starting bonus skill points, getting the rest at 1st?  Etc.)  I’ll also need to work out how to handle starting gold and equipment; maybe have cheaper “starting spellbooks” available that include a few beginner spells, for instance?  That sort of thing.

<h2 id="nolevels">Non-level-based systems</h2>
  <p>
    The way XP works in games like the Story* Systems is surprisingly similar to the various milestone-based systems, including a point for each session played and a point for achieving a story goal.  However, I’m not so sure that awarding XP based on play sessions is the best way to go; some sessions might consist of little more than planning, roleplaying, and fucking around (e.g., three hours of going shopping), while other sessions might be hugely productive, defeating a major adversary and tying up several loose ends.  Honestly, I think the challenge-based XP system I settled on above might be the best approach to use here!  Do take a look at the precise numerical scales and expectations of the specific system you’re using, though; it may be necessary to adjust the value of a standard encounter accordingly, or to just award a handful of points at the end of a session based on an overall assessment of the quantity and severity of challenges faced.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to get a little deeper into the weeds, you can track which challenge each point of XP is awarded for, and require it to be spent on a relevant trait, so you need to apply your skills in order to improve them.  You might also be able to improve things through study and practice: perhaps you can specify that your downtime is being devoted to developing a particular trait, and each week or month or whatever of practice or study earns you 1XP toward that trait, or something.  This frames XP as representing effort and progress toward improving your Traits.  Earmarking XP like this also opens up more options for the Storyguide to grant rewards:  Sure, you can still say that a player’s in-game actions have earned them a new Ally&nbsp;●●, or that this treasure they’ve found grants them Wealth&nbsp;●●●, but you could also say that their assistance has given them <em>Y</em> points of XP toward Contacts with the guild, or that the loot they’ve recovered is worth <em>Z</em> points of Wealth XP.  This is consistent with ideas like Library or Mentor supplying a small amount of bonus XP for certain purposes.  This is perhaps slightly more complexity and bookkeeping, but it’s probably one of the better ways of implementing the improvement-through-use schema in tabletop.
  </p>
  <p>
    It might also be worth menting another use of XP, which is exerting narrative control.  In the Cypher System, for instance, you can spend an XP and tell a little story about your background to give yourself a situational advantage.  But since XP are limited, and are generally the only way to increase the numbers on your character sheet, most players are naturally (and understandably) very reluctant to spend XP for temporary advantages.  But how about letting players hang onto some XP and spend it on the fly, sort of retconning things?  Like, if you really wish you had a particular skill that you lack, but you have the XP to buy it, maybe you can tell a brief story about your background and how or why you’ve actually known this all along, and the Storyguide will let you spend the XP for it right then and there.  The “I know a guy” types of mechanics can instead be realized as spending points to suddenly get a dot or two in Ally or Contacts or something.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you do go this route, it’s reasonable to restrict which types of Traits can be purchased on the fly like this.  It works fine for Ally and Contacts and things like that, whether these points come from initial allotments or are earned along the way; this could always be somebody you formed a relationship with off-screen during downtime, for instance.  But it’s both less logical and less mechanically smooth to use it for, say, core Attributes.  Perhaps you can only do this for picking up <em>new</em> Traits?  Like, anything you already have a score in, it’s established that that’s your rating, and changing it must be done with premeditation.  Things like a new ally or contact, however, that could conceivably have just not come up yet, are much easier to accept.  So, too, are a dot or two in a random Skill you haven’t written down yet.  If you can come up with a little story to make it plausible, then sure.  But that plausibility is key, and not all Merits or Backgrounds work well this this; like, if you have no Resources, it strains credulity to suddenly drop five dots into it and be all, “Oh, I’ve been living on the street, but I’m secretly a billionaire.”  Not to say that it’s impossible, but it’s a hard sell.
  </p>
  <p>
    On a related note, I think the first time I saw XP used as a consumable resource was in 3e, which I believe is also the only edition of D&amp;D to use XP as a resource spellcasters must spend to create magic items and cast certain powerful spells (mainly those with permanent effects).  I understand the game design behind it, as you’re influencing the world; however, it doesn’t seem to fit in as well with D&amp;D as it does with the Cypher and Story* Systems, so I’ll not seriously consider it further here until the scope of this article broadens.
