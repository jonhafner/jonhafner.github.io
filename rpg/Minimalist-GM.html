  <p>Sometimes, a player must roll a test to resist or avoid a spell, trap, or other effect.  Using the table below as a guide.  Remember the advice in the <strong>Powerful Opponents</strong> section.</p>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>STR</td>
        <td>Physical Harm that <em>cannot</em> be dodged.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>DEX</td>
        <td>Physical Harm that <em>can</em> be dodged.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>CON</td>
        <td>Poison, Disease or Death.</td>
      </tr>

  </table>
  <p>If a spell from a traditional OSR or original era game calls for the target of a player’s spell to make a save, the caster must test their INT or WIS to see if the magic cast was powerful enough to overcome their defences (remember the <strong>Powerful Opponents</strong> rule).</p>

  <h2 id="nonhuman-ancestries">Nonhuman ancestries for player characters<a class="headerlink" href="#nonhuman-ancestries" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
  <p>These are solely at your discretion.  My thoughts here are that to qualify for a nonhuman ancestry, a character must satisfy certain restrictions on stats: for example, a dwarf might have to have a CON score higher than their CHA, while an elf would need DEX higher than CON, and a hobbit might need DEX higher than STR.  Look for (and instruct the players to look for) situations where such an ancestry would suggest Advantage or Disadvantage on a test.</p>

  <h2 id="monster-level">Monster level<a class="headerlink" href="#monster-level" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
  <p>A monster’s level determines the number of d8 rolled for its hit points (or take the average, level × 4.5) and the dice rolled for damage when it hits with an attack (or use the average, roughly equal to the level).  See also <strong>Powerful Opponents</strong>.</p>
  <p>(If you are running from a classic module, you can probably use the hp and damage listed there instead if you wish.)</p>
  <!-- TODO: Originally, I was just deciding on damage dice by doubling the level to get the number of faces.  However, that causes the averages to slowly creep up faster than the levels.  Perhaps instead make the average equal the level?  This doesn't change anything until level 6, which should probably be made into just d12.  The 2d6 should be bumped up to level 7, etc.  Also, continue to seek more dice combinations to provide further options. -->

  <p>The GM should roll a d4 every 15 minutes of real world play (you <em>are</em> paying attention, right?) A result of 1-2 means the players will encounter a randomly generated creature or distraction in the following minutes.</p>

  <p>If a magic weapon lists a bonus, characters apply that bonus to their attack and damage rolls using that weapon.  If a magic armor lists a bonus, characters apply that bonus to their defense rolls while wearing that armor.  Many weapons and armors require a certain minimum Hit Die size to be used.</p>
  <!-- NB: This section was almost entirely rewritten.  I'm using HD as a proxy for combat skill, to avoid having to include detailed lists of which weapons and armors can be used by each class.  For normal equipment, it generally doesn't matter; for magic items, if it does matter, they can specify how “martial” a character needs to be using this value. -->

  <!-- TODO: Update! -->
  <p>NB: The following table is currently a barely-touched copy of TBH and has not yet been adapted to my revised Minimalist rules.  The only changes I've made are to the Deadly Centipede and the Goblin, bringing their levels below 1, reordering accordingly, and updating the notes.  Note that “OofA” is for “Out of Action”, a status from TBH that’s roughly analogous to “incapacitated”.</p>

  <p><em>Some people scorn failing forward, I find myself using it when I’m looking to engage a story focused player or when i'm feeling generous and the situation is dire - so some mechanical hooks are useful things to have worked up in advance.</em></p>

  <p>Some monsters in the main rulebook will cause PC's to become Paralysed. Whilst Paralysed a character cannot move, talk or take any actions. At the start of their turn a character can make a CON test, If successful they are no-longer Paralysed and can continue the rest of their turn.</p>
  <p><em>I cut this from the rules for space reasons, it seemed like a GM would be able to come up with something with the implied 'status effect', plus a Clerics advantage on CON tests. You can use the same approach to model lots of impairing effects, Poison, Fire, Insanity, Blindness etc - just vary up the associated attributes.</em></p>
  <h2 id="random-encounters">Random encounters<a class="headerlink" href="#random-encounters" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
  <p>An alternative method of checking for random encounters is to roll a d4 every time the players make a loud noise or stay in a potentially dangerous area longer than 5 minutes. Results of 1 indicate a random encounter.</p>
  <p><em>Not everyone likes or can remember to roll a dice every 15 minutes, this offers a much less regimented approach - giving back the GM some control.</em></p>
  <h2 id="morale">Morale<a class="headerlink" href="#morale" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
  <p>If the number of opponents engaged in combat with the players drops by 50% they are 'broken' and a Reaction roll should be made to determine their new attitude.</p>
  <p>If a character can make a successful CHA test the broken opponents will attempt to flee the combat as quickly as possible. If they have a leader fighting amongst them, the CHA test is taken with Disadvantage.</p>
  <p><em>This is a very 'wargamey' feeling rule, which will add an interesting tactical element to combats, if you're so inclined. And remember if the new reaction roll is favourable, yet the NPC's were trying to kill the players a moment before - its no hard stretch to imagine that they are now grovelling for their lives! All of this should be used as a guide, its recommended a GM should exercise their 'narrative common sense'.</em></p>

  <p><strong><em>If a PC summons a creature, and I want the player to roll attacks/defenses for the creature, should it use one of the PCs stats, or should it have its own statline and HD?</em></strong></p>
  <p>I would have the PC test their relevant stat - especially for 'throwaway' summoned creatures. Perhaps if it was a more regular cast member (like a certain dark elf's panther pet) I'd give it HD and a single line special ability that fits it narratively.</p>
