<h1>Languages</h1>
  <p>
    In a big city, visitors can hear all manner of languages being spoken.  Dwarves haggle over gems in Dwarven, elf sages engage in learned debates in Elven, and preachers call out prayers in Celestial.  The language heard most, however, is Common, a tongue shared by all who take part in the culture at large.  With all these languages in use, it is easy for people to learn other languages, and adventurers often speak several tongues.
  </p>
  <p>
    All characters know how to speak Common.  Most non-humans also speak their corresponding ancestral language.  A smart character (one who had an Intelligence bonus at 1st level) speaks other languages as well, one extra language per point of Intelligence bonus as a starting character.  Select your bonus languages (if any) from the list found in your ancestry’s description.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Literacy:</strong> All characters except barbarians can read and write all languages they speak.  (A barbarian can become literate by spending skill points.)
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Class-Related Languages:</strong> Clerics, druids, and wizards can choose certain languages as bonus languages even if they’re not on the lists found in the ancestry descriptions.  These class-related languages are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Cleric:</em> Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal.</li>
      <li><em>Druid:</em> Sylvan.</li>
      <li><em>Wizard:</em> Draconic.</li>
    </ul>
