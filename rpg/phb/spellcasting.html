<h1>Spellcasting</h1>
<!-- TODO: When discussing somatic components, mention that some spellcasters, such as <a href="wizard.html">wizards</a>, cannot cast spells with somatic components while wearing armor.  Also reference the <em>still spell</em> metamagic. -->

Adjusting things for players making all the rolls gave me some trouble at first, chiefly in terms of the wording: I considered a ``spell attack'' bonus, but that's bad, since it shouldn't be based on BAB, and thus would be confusing.  I briefly considered ``spell penetration'', but that conflicts with existing terminology from 3e surrounding magic resistance.  I think ``spell power'' would be better.  So, e.g., a wizard casting fireball at a bunch of goblins would roll a spell power check for each one, trying to meet or beat their Reflex scores.  Conversely, if an enemy evoker casts fireball on the party, each PC makes a Reflex save against the evoker's spell power score.  The hardest part is phrasing.  Perhaps brief notes can cover most cases?  E.g., ``The burst of flame deals 5d6 fire damage to each target (Reflex save half).''  I'm still not sure how to take those cases that require more explicit wording.  I considered something like, ``If your spell power overcomes [fails to overcome] the target's Will save....''  But maybe I'm making this harder than it needs to be?  “If the target fails their Will save…”  Just like we can talk about an attack being successful or unsuccessful even when it's made by an NPC and thus determined by a PC's Defense roll, saving throws could be determined by opposing spell power checks with no trouble.
