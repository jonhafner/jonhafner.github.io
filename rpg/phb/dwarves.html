<h1>Dwarves</h1>

  <h2>Dwarven Traits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>+2 Constitution, â€“2 Charisma: Dwarves are stout and tough but tend to be gruff and reserved.</li>
      <li>Medium: As a Medium creature, you have no special bonuses or penalties due to your size.</li>
      <li>Your base land speed is 20 feet.  However, you can move at this speed even when wearing medium or heavy armor or carrying a medium or heavy load (unlike other creatures, whose speed is reduced in such situations).</li>
      <li>Darkvision: You can see in the dark up to 60 feet.  Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and dwarves can function just fine with no light at all.</li>
      <li>Stonecunning: You gain a +2 bonus to most Intelligence and Wisdom checks related to stone, metal, and gems.  If you merely come within 10 feet of unusual stonework, you can make a check as if you were actively searching.  You can also intuit depth, sensing your approximate depth underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up.  Dwarves have a sixth sense about stonework, an innate ability that they get plenty of opportunity to practice and hone in their underground homes.</li>
      <li>Weapon Familiarity: Dwarves may treat dwarven waraxes and dwarven urgroshes (see <a href="equipment.html">Equipment</a>) as martial weapons, rather than exotic weapons.</li>
      <li>Stability: Dwarves are exceptionally stable on their feet.  You gain a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped when standing on the ground (but not when climbing, flying, riding, or otherwise not standing firmly on the ground).</li>
      <li>+2 bonus on saving throws against poison: Dwarves are hardy and resistant to toxins.</li>
      <li>+2 bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects: Dwarves have an innate resistance to magic spells.</li>
      <li>+1 bonus to attack rolls against orcs (including half-orcs) and goblinoids (including goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears): Dwarves are trained in the special combat techniques that allow them to fight their common enemies more effectively.</li>
      <li>+4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type (such as ogres, trolls, and hill giants): This bonus represents special training that dwarves undergo, during which they learn tricks that previous generations developed in their battles with giants.</li>
      <li>Automatic Languages: Common and Dwarven.  Bonus Languages: Giant, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, Terran, and Undercommon.  Dwarves are familiar with the languages of their enemies and of their subterranean allies.</li>
    </ul>
