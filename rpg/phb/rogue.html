<h1>Rogue</h1>

<!-- TODO: Consider describing Thieves' Cant as a dialect (or rather, set of dialects or system of linguistic obfuscation), rather than a language: it is generally only known by thieves, and when communicating with a thief in a language you share, you can speak in a way that others don't grasp your meaning. -->

<!-- TODO: Express the thief skill system in this class description, by specifying bonus skill points to be allocated to the Thief Skills; they should include the classics (with a mix of new and old, taking advantage of innovations like Stealth and Handle Traps), but may also include newer skills, such as Gather Information or whatever.  (I was afraid for a while that I might need +6 skill points per level to recreate the 8/level from 3e, but in the pregens, I got it down to +4!  My merging of certain skills was instrumental to this....) -->

<!-- Behind the Curtain, regarding the class name: For quite some time, this was called “Thief”.  That might be wonderfully old-school, but it's also potentially problematic, as it encourages players to steal from their party members.  The only class that's worse is “assassin”.  “Rogue” is a much better name.  In my pregens, instead of a “thief”, I have a “burglar” to play up the breaking-and-entering aspect, with lockpicking and trap handling, rather than picking pockets.  (It's also its own old-school reference, since that's what Bilbo Baggins was called, wasn't it?) -->
