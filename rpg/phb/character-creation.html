<h1>Outline of Character Creation</h1>
<p>
  Think of the following as more of a checklist than a procedure; items are ordered in the traditional fashion for an “organic” character creation, but in practice, one will jump around between steps, starting with the clearest or most compelling choices and filling in the remaining details later.  Just make sure that you have covered all of these points by the time you have finished!
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Determine your base <a href="ability-scores.html">ability scores</a>.</li>
  <li>Choose your <a href="index.html#ancestries">ancestry</a> and <a href="languages.html">languages</a>.  Take note of any special features of your ancestry, including applying any stated modifications to your ability scores.</li>
  <li>Choose your <a href="index.html#classes">character class</a> and record your class features.</li>
  <li>Select your <a href="skills.html">skills</a>.</li>
  <li>Select your <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a>, either purchasing piece by piece or beginning with a starting package from your class, exchanging items as desired.</li>
  <li>Describe your character: appearance, personality, background, religion, etc.</li>
  <li>Record your combat statistics, such as your <a href="hit-points.html#max">hit point maximum</a>, as well as:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Attack bonus:</strong> Your class and level provide you with a Base Attack Bonus (BAB), as given in your class description.  This value is adjusted by various factors: for example, attacks with melee weapons usually add your Strength modifier, while ranged weapons are modified by your Dexterity.  Further modifiers can come from your ancestry, class, or other sources.  You should probably calculate and record your attack bonus for each weapon you have.</li>
    <li><strong>Defense bonus:</strong> Your standard Defense bonus is the sum of your armor bonus, shield bonus, Dexterity modifier, and any other modifiers you may have from other sources.  In special circumstances, you might not be able to gain the full benefit of all your defenses: your “Flat-Footed” Defense bonus excludes your Dexterity bonus and dodge bonuses (if any), representing an inability to react to an attack, while your “Touch” Defense bonus excludes your armor and shield bonuses, applying when an attack need only contact your person rather than penetrate your armor.  If you are Flat-Footed against a Touch attack, you apply none of these bonus types to your Defense, though any other bonuses do still apply, such as a gnome’s or hobbit’s size bonus.  To save time at the table, you might want to calculate and take note of all these variations on your Defense bonus in advance.</li>
    <li><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Your class determines your base saving throw bonuses.  To these numbers, add your Constitution modifier to get your Fortitude save, your Dexterity modifier to get your Reflex save, and your Wisdom modifier to get your Will save.</li>
