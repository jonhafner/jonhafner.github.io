<h1>Combat</h1>





<h2 id="rounds">Rounds</h2>
<p>
  In combat, the action happens in a series of <em>rounds</em>, each representing roughly six seconds of in-game time.  During each round, each combatant gets to take a single <em>turn</em>.  During the first phase, characters can take Fast Turns; following this, anyone who has not yet acted can take a Slow Turn during the second phase.  Once all turns are completed and actions are resolved, you have the End of the Round, during which certain special effects may begin or end, durations measured in rounds are decremented, etc.
</p>
<p>
  Within a phase, turns are resolved in the logical order.  If the order of action matters and it is not clear who should act first, the DM may call for an Initiative Check.  This is usually a Dexterity check, but not always: you might roll Intelligence if casting a wizard spell, or Charisma for social interaction, for instance.
</p>
<p>
  On a Fast Turn, you can take a standard action <em>or</em> a move action, but not both.  On a Slow Turn, you can take both a standard action <em>and</em> a move action.  On either type of turn, you can also take a swift action.  (Most move actions involve movement, but not all of them do; this is a briefer name for what 3e calls “move-equivalent actions”.)
</p>
<p>
  A move action can be thought of as slightly less than a standard action.  Hence, you can exchange a standard action for a move action, but not the other way around.  In other words, during a Slow Turn, you can opt to give up your standard action and take two move actions instead, but you cannot “trade up” in the other direction: without some special effect, you cannot take two standard actions in the same turn.  (A swift action is less than both of these, and can also be swapped in.  If you do nothing else, then, you can take up to two swift actions in a Fast Turn or three in a Slow Turn.)
</p>
<p>
  Some actions take so little time and effort that they are classified as “free actions”.  You may take as many free actions on a turn as the DM deems plausible.

  <p>
    This is mostly borrowed from <a class="offsite" href="http://schwalbentertainment.com/shadow-of-the-demon-lord/"><em>Shadow of the Demon Lord</em></a>.  Note that there are certain respects in which this system resembles a lighter-weight, more streamlined version of the combat phases from the earliest editions of <em>D&amp;D</em>.  In designing <em>SotDL</em>, Schwalb found that more rigid initiative systems were cumbersome and restrictive, and interrupted the flow of the narrative.  Indeed, there are few alternatives that allow tactical freedom and narrative flow while also taking some account of the relative speed of different actions.  [TODO: link to theory document on initiative.]

<h2 id="attacks">Attacks</h2>
<p>
  When a PC attacks an NPC, the attacking player rolls a d20 and adds their Attack bonus.  If this meets or exceeds the target’s Defense, the attack hits, and the attacker rolls damage.  When an NPC attacks a PC, the targeted player rolls a d20 and adds their Defense bonus; if the result is below the attacker’s Attack score, the attempt at defense fails, and the attack is successful.
</p>
<p>
  To represent the unpredictable nature of combat, if the die itself shows a 20 (before modification, i.e., a “natural 20”), an additional +10 bonus is applied to the result.  If a natural 1 is rolled, a –10 penalty is imposed.
</p>
<p>
  Instead of trying to deal damage, any number of special maneuvers might be attempted: disarm, trip, grab, shove, blind, etc.  These are usually resolved as normal attacks (perhaps with some bonus or penalty, at the DM’s discretion), but on a hit, the intended special effect occurs instead of normal damage.
</p>
<details><summary>Behind the Curtain</summary>
  <p>
    Players rolling for their defense in addition to their attacks helps them stay more engaged, shifts the implied sense of agency, and can also help keep the game moving when monsters are attacking multiple PCs simultaneously.  It also removes any possibility of the DM fudging dice, perhaps subconsciously ratcheting up the tension.  Furthermore, it relieves the already overworked DM of a tiny amount of effort and distraction, allowing them to stay more focused on and engaged with the game and the players.
  </p>
  <p>
    This rule comes from the 3.5 <em>Unearthed Arcana</em> pp. 133–4, as well as the 5e Unearthed Arcana rules for <a href="https://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/UA5_VariantRules.pdf">Players Make All Rolls</a>.  This applies not only to attacks, but also to saving throws and spell resistance: see sources for details.  However, the designers’ math is off—subtracting 10 from PCs’ static numbers (like AC or save DCs) to obtain the corresponding bonus is the most sensible thing to do, but then to preserve the probabilities of success and failure, you must add 12, not 11, to the NPCs’ bonuses for attacks and saves.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some (but not all!) editions treated a natural 20 as an automatic hit and a natural 1 as an automatic miss.  This is simple, but it sometimes leads to highly implausible results.  Some modicum of sanity can be restored with little cost in extra complexity with the method given here, which is based on the system presented in the 3.0 <em>DMG</em>, pg.&nbsp;64 (tweaked slightly to fix the math).  Additionally, it meshes nicely with my revised rules for <a href="#critical-hits">critical hits</a>.
  </p>

<h2 id="critical-hits">Critical Hits</h2>
<p>
  If an attack succeeds (or a defense fails) by <em>more than</em> 10, the attack is a <em>critical hit</em>, and additional damage is rolled for the hit.  (This can stack: An attack that succeeds by more than 20 deals yet another set of damage, for effectively triple the normal value; etc.)  Bonus damage (such as from a thief’s backstab) is added on separately and is not doubled on a crit.
</p>
<p>
  Extra damage from a critical hit is handled like a separate hit with respect to choosing special effects in place of damage.  So, if you land a critical hit on a normal attack, you might still deal normal damage, but in lieu of extra damage, you might opt for some special effect, subject to DM approval.  Conversely, if you achieve a critical hit when attempting a special maneuver (say, to disarm your opponent), you might deal normal damage on top of that, or perhaps instead choose an additional effect (like a trip).
</p>
<p>
  Another option for a critical hit is to trade the extra damage for an extra attack instead, whether against the same target or another.
</p>
<details><summary>Behind the Curtain</summary>
  <p>
    Some editions treat a natural 20 on an attack roll as an automatic critical hit, but this sometimes stretches the bounds of credulity, especially if a 19 or better is required to hit the target in the first place.  On the other hand, a highly skilled fighter with advantageous circumstances should be able to deal out loads of damage fairly consistently.  3e tried to remedy both of these situations with its system of threat ranges and damage multipliers, but this ballooned into quite a complex system, touching class features, feat lists, and weapon tables, among other things.  The system presented here is based on comparing attack and defense values, and it should reward high combat skill (and/or good luck) with very little additional complexity.  [TODO: Find the citation for this!  I know I didn’t come up with this myself, but I don’t remember where I found it…]

<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>
  Of course, everything is subject to the constraints of plausibility.  An ooze, for example, is immune to critical hits, cannot be blinded or tripped, and is extra-difficult to push or grab.  A ghost would be immune to nearly all of these special effects.  If uncertain, check with your DM before committing to a course of action that depends upon special outcomes.
