<h1>Cleric</h1>

<p>
  <strong>Spellcasting:</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Temporary notes for handling the transition to <a href="diff.html#spontaneous">spontaneous casting</a>: For the playtest, at first level, each cleric knows four minor spells and their two Level I domain spells.  They can cast three minor spells and one level I spell per day (plus bonus spells from high Wisdom).  See below for how to move forward after the playtest.
</p>
<p>
  The <em>UA</em> rules (pp. 64–65) specify that spontaneous clerics and druids can cast a number of spells per day of a given level equal to one more than the listed value.  (That excludes bonus domain spells, so you could also say that the bonus domain spell slot becomes general.)  Thus, a first-level cleric can cast four minor spells and two level I spells per day.  This is apparently to balance the reduced spell selection, as for sorcerers; however, the sorcerer is balanced vs. the wizard!  Clerics, as written, in any version, have more spells per day than wizards, plus decent combat ability and turning undead (soon to be folded into a more flexible Channel Undead ability).  Druids have various abilities, but still only the same numbers of spell slots as wizards.  Thus, even as spontaneous casters, clerics and druids should hold to the same progression as for wizards—namely, three minor spells and one level I at first level.  (Remember to regularize the pattern for all casters as levels increase, rather than keeping the weird, irregular cutoffs that currently exist!)

  As for spells known, at first level, that's given as four minor spells and two level I spells, <em>plus</em> their two domain spells!  That's a lot, and it breaks the pattern established elsewhere in the table; by that pattern, they should know 0 level I spells (i.e., they only know their domain spells).  (Making a similar adjustment to the column for minor spells known, that would bring those down to just three; however, note that in 3.5, there are no domain spells listed at the minor level, so maybe that's not representative.)  Looking forward, I plan to trim down the core cleric spell selection quite a bit, and also let domains behave a bit more like 2e's spheres, so there won't always be exactly one spell per level in each domain; thus, let's not build in domain spells to this.  I.e., leave the minor column alone, add 2 to each number in the columns for levels II and above, and then roll that pattern back to fill in the column for level I.  (While I'm at it, I may as well also simplify the rule for swapping out spells known: just allow one known spell to be swapped out for another of the same level each time the caster gains a class level.  I see no reason for the additional restrictions.)  [Druids should follow the same progression, but with all forms of <em>summon nature’s ally</em> also known for free.  They are, after all, primary casters!]

<!--

Consider keeping some sort of healing power available as a channel divinity option.  I was thinking of having preserve life in Healing, turn undead in Sun, etc.  This is particularly important if the cure wounds spells are available to all clerics, as I'm inclined to do.  There needs to be some additional benefit to choosing the Healing domain.
