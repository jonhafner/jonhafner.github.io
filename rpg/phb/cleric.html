<h1>Cleric</h1>

<p>
  <strong>Spellcasting:</strong>  Clerics are now <a href="div-spont.html">spontaneous spellcasters</a>.  For now, at first level, each cleric knows four minor spells and their two level I domain spells.  They can cast three minor spells and one level I spell per day (plus bonus spells from high Wisdom).  See the linked document for plans on how to move forward after the playtest.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Turn Undead:</strong>  Once per encounter, a cleric with access to the Good, Life, or Sun domain can attempt to <a href="turn-undead.html">turn undead</a>.  (That’s “turn” in the sense of “turn back”, not “turn into”!)
</p>

<!-- TODO Consider keeping some sort of healing power available as a channel divinity option.  I was thinking of having preserve life in Healing, turn undead in Sun, etc.  This is particularly important if the cure wounds spells are available to all clerics, as I'm inclined to do.  There needs to be some additional benefit to choosing the Healing domain. -->
