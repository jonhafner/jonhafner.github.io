<h1>Proficiencies</h1>
<p>
  For now, proficiencies mostly follow 3.5 rules, in that characters begin with the weapon and armor proficiencies granted by their race and class.  Fighters should probably get a bonus proficiency, which can be spent on learning an exotic weapon or on something like Weapon Focus or Spec.  Moving forward, proficiencies will start to incorporate more systems from 2e, as well as some of the more interesting combat feats from 3e, 4e, and 5e.

  [For example, while the usual non-proficiency penalty is –4 to attack, this is halved to –2 if you are proficient in a sufficiently similar weapon.  (Similarity is not transitive: a light crossbow is similar to both a heavy crossbow and a hand crossbow, but the latter two are not similar to each other.)  Fighters, however, suffer only half these penalties.  Maybe do a 2e-type thing with spending initial proficiency slots on your weapon assortment?  Some of these simple weapons, for instance, sound pretty rare, so I'm not sure what sense this makes…]

<p>
  Normally, every creature is proficient with its own natural weapons.  Even humans are able to punch and kick, though these cause nonlethal damage, and may provoke opportunity attacks from armed opponents; to bypass both of these, buy proficiency in Improved Unarmed Strike.
