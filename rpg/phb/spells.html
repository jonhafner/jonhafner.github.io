<h1>Spells</h1>

<!-- TODO: Switch over to 5e-style scaling by spell slot level, rather than the 0-3e scaling by caster level.  But not until after the first playtest!  Not too many things at a time, now. -->

<h2>Bless</h2>
TODO: make the bonus +1d4 instead of just +1.  This helps players remember it, because you can put that die next to your attack d20 (and other players can see whether they rolled it).  It also helps bless compete better with other options available to the cleric, such as healing.  And of course, it is pretty fun.

<!-- TODO: In the <em>still spell</em> metamagic spell description, probably reference how this impacts wizards (and similar casters) using armor; see the <a href="wizard.html">wizard class description</a> and the discussion of somatic components in <a href="spellcasting.html">Spellcasting</a>. -->
