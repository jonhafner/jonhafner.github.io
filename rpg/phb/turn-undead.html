<h1>Turn Undead</h1>

<p>
  Some characters (such as most good clerics and paladins) have the ability to repel or even destroy undead creatures.  No more than once per encounter, you can attempt to turn undead as a standard action by presenting your holy symbol and speaking a prayer censuring the undead.  (This does not provoke attacks of opportunty, nor does it require the unbroken concentration of spellcasting.)
</p>
<p>
  Make a turning check (1d20 + half your level + your Charisma modifier) against the Will save of each undead creature within 30&nbsp;feet of you that can see or hear you.  If you are successful, the creature is turned for 1&nbsp;minute or until it takes damage.  If you are a cleric (not a paladin) and succeed by more than 10, the creature is instead destroyed outright.
</p>
<p>
  Turned undead flee from you by the best and fastest means available to them.  If they cannot flee, they cower, leaving them flat-footed to attack rolls against them.  If you approach within 10&nbsp;feet of them, however, they overcome being turned and act normally.  (You can stand within 10&nbsp;feet without breaking the turning effect—you just can’t approach them.)

    I’ve borrowed from 2e, 3e, and 5e for this version, in an effort to produce something as simple as possible that’s still in the spirit of classic editions.  The effects of turning are fairly consistent across editions (excluding 4e), but the turning check rules vary considerably.  For reference, here are their respective rules summarized very briefly, skipping many details:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>2nd edition:</strong> You can attempt to turn undead once per encounter.  (No range is specified, just when you “encounter” them.)  Roll 1d20 and consult a table to determine the strongest undead you are able to turn.  (The table is not perfectly regular, but generally, a roll of 20 is exactly what’s needed to turn a creature with three more HD than your level; you have roughly even odds of turning a creature with HD about equal to your level.  You automatically turn undead about three or four HD below your level.  A paladin turns undead as a cleric two levels lower.)  You can turn up to 2d6 undead, starting with the weakest.  The table indicates that undead about five to eight HD below the cleric’s level are destroyed outright (possibly turning additional undead of that type); alternatively, undead are destroyed by clerics of about two to three times their level, except at the low end, where this is closer to four to six.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>3rd edition:</strong> You can attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3&nbsp;+ your Charisma modifier.  (This can be increased with a feat.  Turning is a standard action, but there are no other limits on frequency—it appears that you can attempt to turn repeatedly on consecutive rounds.)  You turn the closest undead first, out to a maximum range of 60 feet; turning is blocked by total cover.  Roll a turning check (1d20 + your Charisma modifier) and consult a table to determine the strongest undead you are able to turn.  (The maximum HD turned is four less than your level if your check is 0 or less, equal to your level on 10–12, four more than your level on 22+.  A paladin turns undead as a cleric two levels lower.)  You turn a number of creatures whose total HD does not exceed 2d6 + your cleric level + your Charisma modifier.  If you have at least twice as many levels as the undead have HD, you destroy any that you would normally turn.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>5th edition:</strong> Starting at 2nd level, you can attempt to turn undead once per short or long rest.  Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw or be turned.  (The DC is your spell save DC, 8&nbsp;+ your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.)  [For comparison, in 3e, the spell save DC is 10 + spell level + ability modifier.]  Starting at 5th level, an undead failing its save is instantly destroyed if its CR is at or below a threshold indicated on a table.  (Undead of CR&nbsp;1/2 or lower are destroyed at 5th level.  For CR&nbsp;1 or more, the cleric must have a level equal to five more than thrice the CR, up to CR&nbsp;4 at 17th level.)  [Paladins of the Oath of Devotion have an ability that functions similarly, except with no mention of outright destruction of targets, though it does also function against fiends as in 2e.  Unlike 2e and 3e, paladins are otherwise no less effective in their turning attempts than clerics of equal level.  Also, a paladin’s spell save DC is based on Charisma, meaning that the effectiveness of their turning attempts is also.]
  </p>
  <p>
    There are <em>some</em> differences in the effects.  Chiefly, in 3e, the creature cowers if it cannot flee, and attacks do not break the effect.  In contrast, in 5e, the creature can Dodge if cornered, and ceases to be turned if it takes any damage.  (2e is silent on these matters.)  As a sort of compromise, I used 3e’s cowering (modfied from granting +2 to attacks against it to being flat-footed), as I feel it’s more plausible, but adopted the end condition of 5e to keep a trapped creature from just becoming a punching bag.
  </p>
  <p>
    I struggled for some time trying to reconcile the different thresholds for outright destruction before the idea to tie it to the turning check leapt into my mind!  This resonates with my critical hit rules, and also correlates with level in approximately the right way.
