<h1>Wizard</h1>

<!-- TODO: Somewhere in the class description (perhaps after mentioning the lack of armor proficiency?), state that wizards cannot cast spells with somatic components while wearing armor, as it interferes with the intricate and subtle movements required.  Reference the Somatic part of the spell component descriptions in the <a href="spellcasting.html">Spellcasting page</a>, and possibly the <em>still spell</em> metamagic spell description.  No need to put anything about it in the core, unless you want to make a passing note in the Armor page about how some classes have special restrictions. -->

<strong>Bonus Language Option:</strong> Draconic.

<!--

One small fragment of use from notes.2Feats.tex: Consider seeking a way that wizards could gain 4e-like Implement Mastery abilities, like Staff of Defense etc.  No reason they can't pick up more than one of these if they want, right?  Or even none at all.  (On the other hand, now that I think about it, they almost seem more like magic items â€“ doubly so given their names.  An actual defensive style with a general staff seems more like a fighter weapon specialization.  Hm.)
