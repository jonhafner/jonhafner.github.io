<h1>What happened to feats?</h1>
<p>
  Feats were an interesting idea, but the implementation was lacking.  One of the biggest problems is their variability and swinginess: they range from surprisingly powerful and flavorful to minor little mathy adjustments that don’t really contribute much.  4e wasn’t much better, and in some ways was worse.  5e is probably an improvement, but their solution was to make each individual feat more powerful (and frequently more complex), while also making the entire system optional.
</p>
<p>
  So, what did I find when I reviewed feats to determine which should stay and which should go?  As I mentioned, some were minor and niche, in some cases even classifiable as “trap” options.  Some are only relevant for one or two classes, and so are really best turned into class features rather than cluttering up the core system.  Some metamagic feats are rendered obsolete by changes to the spell power system, while most other metamagic feats are best realized as metamagic <em>spells</em>.  Item creation feats are no longer required.  (As in previous editions, if you are a spellcaster, you automatically have the ability to research the creation of items appropriate to your class, with rules and guidelines given in the DMG.)  And so forth.

  The few feats remaining are almost entirely combat-related, and thus can be easily implemented as simply a minor extension of the combat proficiency system of previous editions.  (I have nothing to back this up, but my personal suspicion is that this is how feats were invented to begin with: the designers probably started fleshing out proficiencies a bit, and decided to see what else they could fit into the system.  That would explain why so many feats feel lackluster, and give the impression that they were only written in an attempt to add more options and variety.  The design of feats does have the advantage of unifying a system across classes, but at the cost of scattering vital class features across more pages and increasing the complexity of the core game system.)
