<h1>Skills</h1>
<!-- Currently, this is just a first working draft for Playtest Session 2.  TODO: Import more material from both the PHBs and from diff-skills.html. -->
<p>
  Your skills represent your particular areas of expertise.  When you make an ability check for which you have a related skill (subject to the DM’s discretion), you can add your skill bonus to the check.
</p>
<p>
  Some skills have an obvious ability with which they would generally be associated: Acrobatics, for instance, is almost exclusively applied to Dexterity checks.  Others are more versatile: if you are a rogue trained in Stealth, you might add that bonus to a Dexterity check to quietly sneak past some guards, a Wisdom check to notice bandits preparing to ambush your party, or an Intelligence check to find the signet ring hidden <em>somewhere</em> in this office.  These are just examples, of course—applications are limited only by your imagination and your DM’s assessment of plausibility.
</p>
<p>
  Keep in mind that skills indicate special, well, <em>skill</em>; they do not define the entire scope of your abilities.  You certainly do not need to have ranks in Cooking, Perform, or Athletics in order to cook an edible dinner, strum a few chords on a lute, or clamber over a low fence.  Your character can be assumed to be reasonably capable at mundane daily activities.  Actual training suggests something above and beyond.
</p>
<p>
  Each level, you gain a number of skill “points” equal to 2 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1), except at 1st level, when you gain four times this number.  (Some ancestries or classes grant bonus skill points.)  You cannot save these points, but instead spend them immediately to buy “ranks” in various skills.  Each rank gives you a +1 bonus.  Your maximum rank in any single skill is 3 + your character level.
</p>
<p>
  Spending individual points might sound tedious or intimidating, but there’s a better way.  Since large bonuses focused on your specialties are usually more impactful than a broad smattering of small bonuses, unless you have a specific goal in mind, it is recommended that you simply choose a number of skills equal to the number of points you will gain per level (2 + Int mod + other bonuses), and always keep those skills at maximum rank (3 + level).

<h1>Differences from Third Edition – Skills</h1>

<p>
  Skills work mostly as in 3.5, except for the following changes:
</p>

<h2>Acquiring Skill Ranks</h2>
  <p>
    Player characters receive 2 + Int mod skill points per level (minimum 1, quadrupled at first level).  Some ancestries and classes provide bonus skills, as described in their respective entries.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are no longer Class Skills and Cross-Class Skills; anyone can learn any skill they choose with equal facility.  (Of course, some skills work better with certain classes, ancestries, and ability scores than others.)  For the purposes of interpreting the 3.5 rules, treat all skills as Class Skills for all characters.  The Class Skills listed in each class description might be considered as suggested skills for members of that class.
  </p>

<h2>Using Skills</h2>
  <h3>Skill Checks</h3>
    <p>
      The ability score paired with a skill depends on the situation.  The “key ability” stated for a skill is probably still going to be used the majority of the time, but it should not be taken as set in stone.
    </p>
    <h4>Opposed Checks</h4>
      <p>
        In case of a tie, the situation remains unchanged—the status quo persists (as in 5e).  If this does not make sense in this particular situation, and there <em>must</em> be a winner, roll again.
      </p>
    <h4>Untrained Skill Checks</h4>
      <p>
        The question of whether a check can be attempted without training depends on the task at hand, not on the skill being applied.  The DM may rule that without training, you might suffer a penalty to your check or even not be able to make one at all.
      </p>
    <h4>Checks without Rolls</h4>
      <p> <!-- TODO: check against my notes, and import more details as needed! -->
        <strong>Taking 10:</strong> This does not have to be actively chosen <em>instead</em> of rolling; rather, whenever your character is attempting something low-risk and unstressed (at the DM’s discretion), your “unstressed check” number is used as a sort of guaranteed minimum result.  If this is sufficient for the task at hand, a roll might be deemed unnecessary.  Your DM might also use this number as a “passive check”, such as to see if you notice something when not actively looking for it.  In any case, instead of calculating 10 + your ability modifier, you use the ability score itself for your unstressed check.
      </p>
    <h4>Skill Synergy</h4>
      <p>
        Rather than one skill providing a bonus to another, simply combine your bonuses from all relevant skills, up to your usual maximum skill bonus (3 + character level).  Ignore the rest of this subsection.
        <!-- TODO: add examples! -->
      </p>

<h2>Skill Descriptions</h2>
  <p>
    First, note that the skill list is to be made “open”, rather than “closed”.  Skills given are examples, and sometimes have specific effects, but players are encouraged to suggest additional skills (subject to DM approval).  This is particularly so with your “background” skills: consider choosing one or two of your skills to answer the questions of what you did before you became an adventurer and/or what you do in your spare time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Several skills are to be deleted, combined, or otherwise altered:
  </p>
  <h3>Deleted and Deprecated Skills</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Perception skills (Spot, Listen, Search, Sense Motive) are to be realized as flat ability checks, with relevant skills added as appropriate.  For example, a rogue searching carefully for traps can add their Security skill to their Intelligence check.  If a rogue tries to sneak past a guard, the rogue’s Dex + Stealth check would be opposed by the guard’s Wis + Stealth check—knowing something about Stealth helps you know what to look or listen for!  Similarly, a common replacement for Sense Motive might be Wis + Bluff.</li>
      <li>Concentration is no longer suggested as a primary skill (though you’re certainly free to select it if it’s key to your character).  The applications to spellcasting will be replaced with a system of caster level checks.
        <details><summary>Behind the Curtain</summary>
          <p>
            While the skill supposedly has other applications, in practice, it’s almost exclusively invoked when a spellcaster must make a check to avoid fumbling a casting or losing concentration on an ongoing effect.  Consequently, this skill (along with Spellcraft) has been criticized as a “skill tax” on spellcasters.  The important mechanics of both can be expressed adequately with a caster level check, perhaps with an appropriate ability modifier (such as Con to resist damage, or Wis to ignore a distraction).
          </p>
        </details>
      </li>
      <li>Spellcraft is no longer needed; some of its features can be folded into Knowledge (arcana), while others are more appropriate as a caster level check modified by Intelligence.</li>
      <li>Use Magic Device is no longer needed; with revisions to magic items, it’s rarely relevant, and if it is, it belongs as a class feature instead.</li>
      <li>Use Rope is no longer suggested as a primary skill (though you’re certainly free to select it if it’s key to your character).  It can be assumed than any seasoned adventurer can do basic things with ropes and knots, and for more advanced work, a relevant profession or other skill might apply.</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Combined Skills</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Balance and Tumble are now part of Acrobatics.</li>
      <li>Climb, Jump, and Swim are now part of Athletics.</li>
      <li>Disable Device and Open Lock are now part of Security.</li>
      <li>Hide and Move Silently are now part of Stealth.</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Renamed and Refocused Skills</h3>
    <ul>
      <!-- TODO: Bluff as Subterfuge or Deception or something? -->
      <li>Decipher Script can be folded into a new Knowledge (linguistics), which also has applications to identifying unknown languages, making and breaking secret codes, etc.</li>
      <li>Gather Information is broadened into the more general Streetwise.  Alternatively, a different spin on it could become Investigation or an appropriate Profession.</li>
      <li>Handle Animal is renamed Animal Handling, for grammatical consistency.</li>
      <li>Heal is renamed Medicine, for clarity and consistency.</li>
    </ul>
