<h1>Skills</h1>
<!-- Currently, this is just a first working draft for Playtest Session 2.  TODO: Import more material from both the PHBs and from diff-skills.html. -->
<!-- TODO: As a possible example of the range of possibilities here – likely after discussing non-exclusivity and the two background questions – perhaps include mention that when one group of players was asked to make up some of their own skills, the results included Alchemy, Blacksmith, Cooking, Fishing, Flirting, Repair, and “Grad student at a wizard’s college”! -->
<!-- TODO: Note that Legerdemain includes not just sleight of hand and picking pockets, but also things like shoplifting, cheating at cards or dice, and other acts of subtlety and misdirection! -->

  Your skills represent your particular areas of expertise.  When you make an ability check for which you have a related skill (subject to the DM’s discretion), you can add your skill bonus to the check.
</p>
<p>
  Some skills have an obvious ability with which they would generally be associated: Acrobatics, for instance, is almost exclusively applied to Dexterity checks.  Others are more versatile: if you are a rogue trained in Stealth, you might add that bonus to a Dexterity check to quietly sneak past some guards, a Wisdom check to notice bandits preparing to ambush your party, or an Intelligence check to find the signet ring you know is hidden <em>somewhere</em> in this office.  These are just examples, of course—applications are limited only by your imagination and your DM’s assessment of plausibility.
</p>
<p>
  Note that skills indicate special, well, <em>skill</em>; they do not define the entire scope of your abilities.  You certainly do not need to have ranks in Cooking, Perform, or Athletics in order to cook an edible dinner, strum a few chords on a lute, or clamber over a low fence.  Your character can be assumed to be reasonably capable at mundane daily activities.  Skill ranks suggest actual training, extensive experience, exceptional talent, or some combination of these.
</p>
<p>
  Each level, you gain a number of skill “points” equal to 2 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1), except at 1st level, when you gain four times this number.  (Some ancestries or classes grant bonus skill points.)  You cannot save these points, but instead spend them immediately to buy “ranks” in various skills.  Each rank gives you a +1 bonus.  Your maximum rank in any single skill is 3 + your character level.
</p>
<p>
  Spending individual points might sound tedious or intimidating, but there’s a useful shortcut:  Since large bonuses focused on your specialties are usually more impactful than a broad smattering of small bonuses, unless you have a specific goal in mind, it is recommended that you simply choose a number of skills equal to the number of points you will gain per level (2 + Int mod + other bonuses), and always keep those skills at maximum rank (3 + level).  (Exception: If penalties reduce you to only a single skill per level, you might prefer to select two skills and split your points evenly between them to retain some amount of versatility.)
