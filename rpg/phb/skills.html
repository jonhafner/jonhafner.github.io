<h1>Skills</h1>

<p>
  For now, skills work mostly as in 3.5, except for the following changes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Player characters receive 2 + Int mod skill points per level (minimum 1, quadrupled at first level).  Some classes (currently just the thief, but probably more later) provide bonus skills.</li>
  <li>There are no longer Class Skills and Cross-Class Skills; anyone can learn any skill they choose with equal facility.  (Of course, some skills work better with certain classes, races, and ability scores than others.)</li>
  <li>The skill list is “open”, not “closed”.  Skills given are examples, and sometims have specific effects, but players are encouraged to suggest additional skills (subject to DM approval).  This is particularly so with your two “background” skills, sometimes shorthanded as a profession and a hobby.</li>
  <li>There are no more perception skills (Spot, Listen, Search); these are realized as flat ability checks, with relevant skills added as appropriate.  (For example, a rogue searching carefully for traps can add their Handle Traps skill to their Intelligence check.  If a rogue tries to sneak past a guard, the rogue's Dex + Stealth check would be opposed by the guard's Wis + Stealth check—knowing something about Stealth helps you know what to look or listen for!)</li>
  <li>Move Silently and Hide are now part of the Stealth skill.</li>
  <li>Tumble is renamed Acrobatics, and has appropriately broader application.</li>
  <li>Jump, Climb, and Swim are now part of the Athletics skill.</li>
</ul>
