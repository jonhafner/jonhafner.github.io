<h1>Experience points and level advancement</h1>

<h2>Experience points</h2>
  <p>
    Experience points (XP) are a measure of what a character has learned from overcoming—or at least surviving—adversity.  Defeating (not necessarily killing) a foe in combat, or getting past a dangerous trap, or successfully navigating a tense diplomatic situation … each of these carries a risk of failure, and avoiding the negative consequences such a failure would bring requires some combination of skill, luck, and cleverness.  Or, maybe you don’t avoid the consequences, but you survive anyway; you can still learn something from the experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other examples of challenges can include tricking a guard into leaving their post, sneaking past a sentry, negotiating a trade deal with a dwarf lord, dealing with a tight-lipped sage, getting the right people drunk, racing through the city to catch a fleeing burglar, or several days of overland travel to find a hidden cave.  If it was tricky and took some work on the players’ parts, or cost the characters some of their resources, it’s probably worth some XP.
  </p>



<h2>Calculating XP rewards</h2>
  <p>
    Each challenge is worth 0–4XP, depending on its threat level.  A “standard encounter” is one in which characters incurred damage and/or were required to consume resources to survive the encounter; roughly speaking, about 20% of their resources (hit points, spell slots, consumable items, etc.) should be used up, on average.  They would need to rest, recover, and/or restock after about four such encounters; a fifth would be likely to wipe them out.  A “deadly” encounter, in contrast, is one that nearly <em>does</em> wipe them out, perhaps threatening a TPK: one or more character fatalities may occur, and the survivors may be forced to retreat.  In summary:
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr><th>XP</th><th style="text-align:left">Threat</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>0</td><td style="text-align:left">Trivial</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1</td><td style="text-align:left">Easy</td></tr>
      <tr><td>2</td><td style="text-align:left">Standard</td></tr>
      <tr><td>3</td><td style="text-align:left">Hard</td></tr>
      <tr><td>4</td><td style="text-align:left">Deadly</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>
    For challenges that do not threaten physical harm, use this as a rough starting point for estimating the challenge or stakes more abstractly, as appropriate.  To assess the XP value of a diplomatic negotiation, for instance, consider how formidible the opposition is, how long the negotiation takes, and how serious the consequences for failure are.
  </p>
  <p>
    This system is modeled after that used in <em>Dungeon Crawl Classics</em>; one GM using that system gave an example of how they assigned XP for the various encounters in a short adventure they wrote:  Traps were worth 2XP if defeated or bypassed, or 1XP to survivors otherwise.  A minor puzzle or mystery granted 1XP if solved.  Most monsters were 2XP, but the major battle at the end would be worth 2–4XP, depending on how it shook out.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the intent is to award XP based on how challenging an encounter <em>actually was</em>, not on how challenging you <em>thought it would be</em>!  In particular, challenge ratings (CRs) given for creatures and hazards are approximate measures of their power, and are intended as an aid for designing appropriate encounters; they do <em>not</em> directly translate into XP rewards.  An encounter with low-CR creatures can quickly turn deadly (imagine a run-in with Tucker’s Kobolds, or getting ambushed by darkmantles in your sleep), while bypassing a serious threat through sheer luck doesn’t teach a person much.  That said, remember to reward cleverness: if the party survives a significant challenge through cleverness rather than force, don’t cheat them out of XP.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note also that these rewards are <em>per-person</em>, and do not require division.  This system implicitly handles the effects of having a larger or smaller party than is typical: if the group size changes the difficulty, that affects the quantity of XP each member earns.  Further note that if there are significant differences between how much an encounter challenged various PCs (or in how much risk or cost different PCs took on), you can easily award different quantities of XP to different characters.  For more on this topic, see my <a href="../theory/advancement.html#DCC">more thorough discussion of this system elsewhere</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Observe that since there is essentially nothing to calculate, and the rewards are instead based on your holistic assessment of how an encounter felt, you should determine an encounter’s value immediately.  You can award XP right away, or take note of it for later if you think that would be better for the flow of play.  The process of gaining a level should still require some amount of downtime for training and reflection, so you needn’t fear the problems of dealing with PCs leveling up in the middle of a dungeon.
  </p>



<h2>Advancing levels</h2>
  <p>
    Each standard level costs 20XP.  (Gaining an Apprentice level only costs 10XP, as does advancing from Apprentice to 1st level.)  A character with sufficient XP can spend the required amount (subtracting it from their total) and gain a level.  In some campaigns, training rules may be enacted; lacking those, it should at least be required that a character at least have a long rest to reflect and recover before gaining a level.  Furthermore, it is reasonable to restrict how quickly successive levels can be gained; you might require, say, at least one week per level to pass before another level can be gained.  So, for example, a character who advances to 2nd level might have to wait at least two weeks to reach 3rd level.
  </p>



<h2>Expected pacing</h2>
  <p>
    This system is based around an expectation of about ten standard encounters per level.  In practice, characters are likely to encounter more easy encounters than hard ones—at least if they are to survive—and this difference tends to become more significant as they grow in power, so the pace of advancement should naturally slow over time.  Furthermore, higher-level characters tend to have more other things to do, such as interacting with each other and NPCs, and spending time managing or working on other projects.
