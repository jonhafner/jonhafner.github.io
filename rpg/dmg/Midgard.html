  <h1>Midgard</h1>
  <p>
    This campaign setting has its roots in some brainstorming I was doing for the Inner Planes in a homebrewed D&amp;D cosmology, before I realized that it worked best as its own separate thing.  So here we are!
  </p>
  <p>
    The world described here is self-contained, without easy access to other worlds or planes.  It might be an infinite demiplane deep in the Ethereal, or it might be part of a different cosmos entirely.  Travel into this world from elsewhere has happened on at least one occasion—perhaps on many occasions, if one of my recent ideas holds—but it is not yet clear whether it is possible to escape, let alone how this might be achieved.
  </p>

  <h2>The Inner Planes</h2>

    <h3>The Geometry of the Inner Planes</h3>
      <p>
        In short, while each plane is infinite in at least one direction, containing unlimited quantities of its fundamental substance or essence, it is also possible to travel from any of these places to any other by moving in the “direction” of the appropriate element (though not all pairs of planes border each other directly).  Loosely speaking, you can think of the Prime as being a sort of metaphysical or higher-dimensional sphere surrounding the Inner Planes.  At the inner core are the pure planes themselves.  As you move outward, though, things become increasingly Prime-like, to the point that near the outer edges, you pretty consistently have discernable terrain and geography where the Air-like elements meet the Earth- or Water-like elements.  Generally speaking, in these outer areas, up is in the direction of Air or Fire, and down is in the direction of Earth or Water.  (At least, this is so near the “surface” of the more Prime-like regions: you can walk from the Faewild through the charred lands of Fire into the Shadowfell, or sail across the surface of the Water between the shores of those two lands.  Far above or below this surface, however, gravity gets weaker, until in the deepest depths of Earth or Water, or the greatest heights of Air or Fire, there is no sense of “up” or “down” at all!)  Wherever you are, you can move in the direction of a nearby element, or further “in” or “out”.  See the descriptions of the individual planes for more information on their composition, geography, and nearby elements.
      </p>

    <h3>The Faewild</h3>
      <p>
        Somewhere between the Positive and Prime lies a region commonly called the Faewild.  Here, life is more abundant, magic is more powerful, colors are brighter and more vibrant, and light is more intense.  Indeed, it is difficult to find anyplace truly dark on this plane.  At night, the sky is so full of stars that a dim light persists, even penetrating the forest canopy; most underground caverns have luminescent fungi or algae or the like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the Faewild is filled with lush green forests and rolling, grassy hills, and as the name suggests, this is the home of the fae.  (Originally, at any rate.  Some beings of fae heritage have long made their homes elsewhere, such as the elves of the Prime and the eladrin of Arborea.)  Do not make the mistake of confusing light and life with “good”, however: the fair folk are notorious for following moral codes that are seemingly <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">orthogonal</a> to human moral and ethical systems.  Travelers through forests and grasslands are advised to exercise caution when crossing hedgerows, avoid rings of mushrooms at all costs, and just generally stick to the known paths when possible, lest you accidentally find yourself <em>someplace else</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The coast of the Faewild borders the cleanest, clearest, freshest parts of the surface of Water.  Traveling further inland can instead take you to the great sparkling Mineral fields, the lava plains sitting atop Magma, or the scorching expanse of the outer parts of Fire.  Burrowing can take you into Mineral or Earth.  With flight, you can also move in the directions of Air, Radiance, Lightning, or Steam.  If you walk or fly in the direction of greatest brightness, you will find that Radiance converging with Lightning, Steam, and Minerals to lead to the Positive Energy Plane itself.
      </p>

    <h3>The Shadowfell</h3>
      <p>
        The Shadowfell is a dark, gloomy place that lies between the Negative and Prime Planes.  Colors are muted, light is dim, and even emotions are dampened.  Death and undeath are prominent forces here, so while most of the landscape is not openly hostile, many of its denizens are.  Nevertheless, as with the Faewild, “good” and “evil” are not particularly relevant concepts here; the shadar-kai, for instance, are a fae people bound to this plane, and not all are as dark of heart as they may appear.  [Try to merge the 3e and 4e versions somehow?]  Ancient ruins, forgotten graveyards, dead forests, and other such regions are the most likely places to find the boundary between the Prime and the Shadowfell to be weakened.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps the most famous (and feared) location in the Shadowfell is the Domain of Dread, a mist-shrouded demiplane governed by dark and mysterious Powers that serves as a kind of twisted prison for many of the most vile mortals—and, unfortunately, many non-vile mortals who are ensnared incidentally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traveling across land, you will find the Shadowfell to be mostly surrounded by vast plains of ash, dust, salt, and/or ice, depending on the direction you take.  In some places, you can find a coast that gives way to dark, murky, filthy brine, at the boundary of Water.  Flight or burrowing can take you into Air or Earth, respectively.  If you set off in the direction of the deepest darkness, however, you will find the air getting thinner and colder, gravity getting weaker, and the ground getting less and less solid, as Ash, Dust, and Vacuum all converge on you and you approach the Negative Energy Plane itself.
      </p>

    <h3>The Plane of Fire</h3>
      <p>
        [Stuff about the inner, pure parts of the plane, but also the outer, more habitable parts, where the ground is hot coals, the air is filled with smoke and sparks, etc.  Not immediately deadly, though it will cause you harm pretty quickly if you lack adequate protection.  Walking can take you deeper in, where you can find the City of Brass, for instance, or you can walk in the direction of fields of Magma or Ash.  Flight can take you deeper into Smoke, or you can skirt through it, veering quickly toward Air; alternatively, you can head toward Radiance.]
      </p>

    <h3>The Plane of Ash</h3>
      <p>
        [From here, you can walk toward Fire, as the ashes and embers under your feet grow warmer; or, you can veer toward Magma or Dust on a path toward Earth.  You can also trek into the Shadowfell, or instead turn away from the warmth and light, taking a path on which the air and the ashy ground alike become colder and thinner, headed more directly toward the Negative Energy Plane.]
      </p>

    <h3>The Plane of Water</h3>
      <p>
        The outermost portion of this plane shares a boundary with some of the outer parts of Air, creating the surface of an infinite sea.  Creatures or objects can swim or sail at this surface much as they would in a large body of water on a Prime world.  Some directions will take you to the muddy shores of Ooze; travel in brighter, warmer directions will see the water getting ever cleaner, clearer, and fresher, as you head toward the Faewild and Steam.  Other directions will take you muck and brine as you approach the Shadowfell and Salt, or into colder and colder waters with larger and more frequent icebergs as you approach Ice.  Flight will generally take you into the Air, unless you're far enough in the Positive direction to head into Steam.
      </p>

    <h3>Etc.</h3>
      <p>
        [I just put a few places here that I had specific ideas for.  I hope this illustrates the principles!]
