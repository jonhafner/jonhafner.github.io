  <h1>Manual of the Planes</h1>
  <p>
    [Currently, most of what follows is the result of some brainstorming that happened after reading the first couple sections of Lovecraft’s “The Whisperer in Darkness”.  For a while, I was considering more significant changes to things, like blending the Inner Planes together into a common geography and eliminating the Ethereal entirely.  I've since realized that the former works best on its own—see my Midgard setting for the later development of that—and the latter would break too much established D&amp;D lore to be worth the very minor gains.  So, um, a lot of the things below are just some off-the-cuff thoughts.  Many of them are probably obvious, redundant things already stated in the canon, and others probably contradict it in ways that the canon should actually take precedence.  Take everything with a grain of salt until these issues are reconciled!]
  </p>

  <h2>The Prime Material Plane</h2>
    <p>
      There is only one Prime Material Plane, though it contains countless worlds, mostly separated by vast expanses of interstellar space.  So great are these distances that physical and magical laws and properties can vary slightly from world to world.  Travel between worlds <em>without</em> leaving the Prime Material Plane is difficult; even with the use of powerful magic, it can still take months or years to travel between nearby worlds.  More distant worlds could take centuries, millennia, or even longer to reach.  Faster transit requires extraplanar passage.  [I figure I can steal a lot of stuff from Spelljammer, but I don't want all the mess of Crystal Spheres and Phlogiston.  Just, like, have what are basically spaceships; maybe practical interstellar travel involves stepping sideways into the Astral, where travel is much faster?  Sounds like an analogue to hyperspace!]
    </p>

  <h2>The Astral Sea</h2>
    <p>
      [Most of what I used to have here was based on an idea I had for eliminating the Ethereal Plane from the cosmology.  I have since reversed this decision, so just consult the canonical works.  All that's left is some stuff that may or may not be useful, just off the top of my head; maybe investigate its consequences later.]  The astral space between other planes is called the Astral Sea, which, while not free from hazards, does provide a fairly reliable means of travel from one plane to another.  (Note that the Astral only overlaps with the “top” or “first” layer of each Outer Plane; lower layers are not directly accessible from the Astral, nor are the Inner Planes.)  [Rather than the silvery void described in some editions, I envision this as something more like a starry expanse—like outer space, but <em>different</em>, somehow.  And, sure, okay, probably a bit more silvery!  Despite the lack of a literal sea, some of Matt Colville's descriptions in the early episodes of <em>The Chain</em> might be useful.  (Actually, could part of the Astral actually be the “deep space” one must traverse to travel between the various Prime worlds?  Like, does there need to be just a single Prime Material Plane, or can there be a collection of Prime Material Planes?  I dunno.  Something to consider.)]
    </p>

  <h2>The Outer Planes</h2>
    <p>
      These are treated quite thoroughly elsewhere.  It is worth emphasizing that the Great Wheel is not a <em>physical</em> arrangement, but rather a conceptual arrangement of the relationships between the planes.  Many Outer Planes—and all of those with primary positions on the Great Wheel [verify this]—are infinite in extent.  Thus, you cannot leave the plane by just walking in a straight line: assuming the local geography does not interfere, you'll just spend the rest of your life walking through that plane.  Most Outer Planes do have various permanent portals and/or coexistence points connecting them to other “nearby” planes, if you can find those.  (Again, proximity is measured by alignment or some other conceptual concordance, not any sort of physical location, as distance is of questionable meaning in the Astral Sea.)  Recall that the topmost layer of each Outer Plane also coexists with the Astral Plane, so that provides another means of interplanar travel.
    </p>

  <h2>The Far Realm</h2>
    <p>
      The Far Realm lies “beyond” the Deep Astral, outside the boundaries of the known Multiverse.  It is at least as old as the known material planes, and possibly older.  The Far Realm may once have been in closer contact with our multiverse than it currently is, but if so, that was many aeons ago, and the evidence of that is sparse and generally unknown.  The realms remained separate for ages, with the current degree of interaction being much more recent.  Well, recent on the cosmic scale: centuries, or perhaps a millennium or so.  Worryingly, sightings of aberrations and prevalence of psionic phenomena seem to be on the rise, suggesting that something worse is to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Illithids and the like are typical aberrations, assumed to have their origins in the Deep Astral, or possibly the Far Realm itself.  The Mi-Go sound like another type of aberration, but with a comparable feel: roughly the size and shape of humans, but with many limbs, crab-like claws, antennae, ... very athropod / insectoid / crustacean, except for their leathery or membraneous wings!  These wings are not very good at managing controlled flight through air in the gravity well of a planet, but they are able to push against and glide through the ether, allowing travel through the space between worlds.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [In Lovecraft's stories, the glyphs in the <em>Necronomicon</em> are said to be quite distinctive; can I find “authentic” samples for use for Far Realm-type societies?]
    </p>

  <h2>The Ethereal Plane</h2>
    <p>
      [Originally, I had some stuff here explaining why I was cutting it and how to deal with that, but instead, let's just take it by-the-book.  Consult the various Planescape materials, including the supplement focused on the Ethereal specifically.]
    </p>

  <h2>The Inner Planes</h2>
    <p>
      Where the Astral and Outer Planes are planes of thought and belief, the Inner Planes are planes of substance and essence.  They are the ultimate sources of Positive and Negative Energy and the assorted material Elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      In their purest form, most of these planes are entirely inhospitable to most living beings.  (Even the Positive Energy Plane, the so-called Plane of Life, will fill every living cell with a surplus of energy until it bursts.)  Some are not (such as Air); the others can be survived with appropriate magical protections.  However, portions of these planes are “near” the Prime Material Plane, even coexisting with portions of Prime worlds at key points.  This means that a traveler can easily (even accidentally) cross over between the Prime and a nearby Inner Plane at certain locations.  For example, a faerie ring deep in the forest may take you to the Faewild, while a volcano likely contains a link to the Plane of Magma.  [When I wrote this, I was treating the Faewild and Shadowfell as part of the system of Inner Planes; I don't think I am anymore, so find another example.  Though the example given still applies!  This is just the wrong section for it.]  As each Inner Plane is a concentration and distillation of substance and essence that is usually much more sparse on the Prime, distances through these elemental planes are usually much shorter.  A savvy traveler could make use of interplanar coexistence points and local planar geography to travel from one part of the world to another, or even to a different world entirely, by stepping into one of these planes.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, with proper protections and the correct technique, a traveler might enter a volcano, pass into the Plane of Magma, navigate a moderate distance to another outlet from Magma, and emerge in another volcano miles (or parsecs!) from the first.  Much easier, however, might be to pass through a more hospitable plane, like Water or Air.  These present their own difficulties, of course—not the least of which being the problem of finding a crossover point in the middle of a vast ocean with no discernable landmarks!  And then there are the sea monsters….  You get the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can probably see by now, while the nearby regions of Inner Planes <em>can</em> be used as a fast means of travel, there are sufficient risks involved that this is not generally recommended.  All else being equal, if you have the means, the Astral or Ethereal Plane is probably a much safer and easier way to get from one location on the Prime to another.  (Also much more convenient, as these elemental planar touchpoints are not exactly commonplace: The wildest parts at the core of the largest forests might coëxist with the Faewild, but other touchpoints, like faerie circles, tend to be small and short-lived.  The deepest, darkest caverns might provide passage to Earth, and as mentioned, the heart of a volcano probably leads to Magma, but these places are hard to reach.  And of course, the parts of the sea farthest from land, over the deepest parts of the ocean, where few ships dare to sail, might lead to the nearby part of Water, a sea of infinite expanse—from which you can sail to a sea on any other world, if you can navigate accurately!  [If there even is a part of Water that has a surface—maybe near Air?  I dunno.]  Etc.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, these planes also contain worthwhile destinations of their own, such as the Gloomwrought, the City of Midnight, in the Shadowfell, the various faerie demesnes in the Faewild, the City of Brass in the Plane of Fire, and so forth.  [Again, move the Faewild and Shadowfell stuff to their appropraite sections, and find more local examples.]  A number of powerful beings make their homes in the Inner Planes.  Thinking of them as “flyover territory” is a mistake, for many reasons!
    </p>

    <h3>The Geometry of the Inner Planes</h3>
      <p>
        [Again, return to the arrangement described in Planescape, more or less.  I will point out that within each Inner Plane, there are four directions you can go that will take you toward neighboring planes, but the other two—along the third orthogonal axis—remain within the current plane!  This is how they can have infinite elemental content while still permitting travel.  Crudely, consider a human walking on the surface of the Earth.  If you're standing on an ice sheet at the North Pole, you can walk in various directions to head toward various other land masses, but if you want to go to the South Pole, you can't walk straight toward it: you'll have to walk toward something else first, passing through other regions along the way.  Similarly, if you're in Water, there's no direction that'll take you toward Fire—you'll have to instead head toward Air, Earth, Positive, or Negative, and make your way around that way.  It's not a perfect analogy, of course, since you simply <em>cannot</em> “walk” up or down from the North Pole; you can move in the equivalent direction in Water, it's just that you remain in Water.  In other words, that spherical arrangement of the Inner Planes should maybe be taken as a diagrammatic representation of something more like a hypersphere?]
      </p>

  <h2>The Faewild and Shadowfell</h2>
    <p>
      First, I should state that these planes are not strictly necessary: the game got along just fine before their introduction in 4e.  (The Eladrin, for instance, hailed from Arborea; the Shadar-kai came from the Plane of Shadow.)  Still, it might be useful to incorporate them as planes “parallel” to the Prime Material.  I intend to ignore them for now, but if I do wish to incorporate them at some point, consult the 4e and 5e materials, and perhaps some of my notes on the corresponding regions in Midgard.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I do bring them in, don't half-ass it.  Make these places distinctive and dangerous.  For example, the Faewild should be a magical and mysterious place, probably connected to the Positive Energy plane.  Here, life is more abundant, magic is more powerful, colors are brighter and more vibrant, and light is more intense.  Indeed, it is difficult to find anyplace truly dark on this plane.  At night, the sky is so full of stars that a dim light persists, even penetrating the forest canopy; most underground caverns have luminescent fungi or algae or the like.  Most of the Faewild is filled with lush green forests and rolling, grassy hills, and as the name suggests, this is the home of the fae.  (Originally, at any rate.  Some beings of fae heritage have long made their homes elsewhere, such as the elves of the Prime and the eladrin of Arborea.)  Do not make the mistake of confusing light and life with “good”, however: the fair folk are notorious for following moral codes that are seemingly <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">orthogonal</a> to human moral and ethical systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both analogously and conversely, the Shadowfell is a dark, gloomy place that has ties to the Negative Energy Plane.  Colors are muted, light is dim, and even emotions are dampened.  Death and undeath are prominent forces here, so while most of the landscape is not openly hostile, many of its denizens are.  Nevertheless, as with the Faewild, “good” and “evil” are not particularly relevant concepts here; the shadar-kai, for instance, are a fae people bound to this plane, and not all are as dark of heart as they may appear.  [Try to merge the 3e and 4e versions somehow?]
    </p>
    <p>
      When I said these planes were dangerous, I didn't mean only for those mortals who choose to travel there, as their entanglement with the Prime means that even the unwitting can be ensnared where the boundaries between planes are weakened.  Travelers through forests and grasslands are advised to exercise caution when crossing hedgerows, avoid rings of mushrooms at all costs, and just generally stick to the known paths when possible, lest you accidentally find yourself <em>someplace else</em>.  Similarly, explorers of ancient ruins, forgotten graveyards, dead forests, and other such places might find themselves stumbling into the Shadowfell without realizing or intending it.
