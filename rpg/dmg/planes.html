  <h1>Manual of the Planes</h1>
  <p>
    [Currently, most of what follows is the result of some brainstorming that happened after reading the first couple sections of Lovecraft’s “The Whisperer in Darkness”.]
  </p>

  <h2>The Prime Material Plane</h2>
    <p>
      There is only one Prime Material Plane, though it contains countless worlds, mostly separated by vast expanses of interstellar space.  So great are these distances that physical and magical laws and properties can vary slightly from world to world.  Travel between worlds <em>without</em> leaving the Prime Material Plane is difficult; even with the use of powerful magic, it can still take months or years to travel between nearby worlds.  More distant worlds could take centuries, millennia, or even longer to reach.  Faster transit requires extraplanar passage.  [I figure I can steal a lot of stuff from Spelljammer, but I don't want all the mess of Crystal Spheres and Phlogiston.  Just, like, have what are basically spaceships; maybe practical interstellar travel involves stepping sideways into the Astral, where travel is much faster?  Sounds like an analogue to hyperspace!]
    </p>

  <h2>The Astral Sea</h2>
    <p>
      The Prime Material, the various Outer Planes, and countless demiplanes are scattered throughout the Astral Plane; the plane itself surrounds, permeates, and lies parallel to and coexistent with these other planes, accessible throughout most of them (via spells like <em>astral projection</em> and whatnot).  The astral space between other planes is called the Astral Sea, which, while not free from hazards, does provide a fairly reliable means of travel from one plane to another.  (Note that the Astral only overlaps with the “top” or “first” layer of each Outer Plane; lower layers are not directly accessible from the Astral, nor are the Inner Planes.)  [Rather than the silvery void described in some editions, I envision this as something more like a starry expanse—like outer space, but <em>different</em>, somehow.  And, sure, okay, probably a bit more silvery!]
    </p>

  <h2>The Outer Planes</h2>
    <p>
      These are treated quite thoroughly elsewhere.  It is worth emphasizing that the Great Wheel is not a <em>physical</em> arrangement, but rather a conceptual arrangement of the relationships between the planes.  Many Outer Planes—and all of those with primary positions on the Great Wheel [verify this]—are infinite in extent.  Thus, you cannot leave the plane by just walking in a straight line: assuming the local geography does not interfere, you'll just spend the rest of your life walking through that plane.  Most Outer Planes do have various permanent portals and/or coexistence points connecting them to other “nearby” planes, if you can find those.  (Again, proximity is measured by alignment or some other conceptual concordance, not any sort of physical location, as distance is of questionable meaning in the Astral Sea.)  Recall that the topmost layer of each Outer Plane also coexists with the Astral Plane, so that provides another means of interplanar travel.
    </p>

  <h2>The Far Realm</h2>
    <p>
      The Far Realm lies “beyond” the Deep Astral, outside the boundaries of the known Multiverse.  It is at least as old as the known material planes, and possibly older.  The Far Realm may once have been in closer contact with our multiverse than it currently is, but if so, that was many aeons ago, and the evidence of that is sparse and generally unknown.  The realms remained separate for ages, with the current degree of interaction being much more recent.  Well, recent on the cosmic scale: centuries, or perhaps a millennium or so.  Worryingly, sightings of aberrations and prevalence of psionic phenomena seem to be on the rise, suggesting that something worse is to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Illithids and the like are typical aberrations, assumed to have their origins in the Deep Astral, or possibly the Far Realm itself.  The Mi-Go sound like another type of aberration, but with a comparable feel: roughly the size and shape of humans, but with many limbs, crab-like claws, antennae, ... very athropod / insectoid / crustacean, except for their leathery or membraneous wings!  These wings are not very good at managing controlled flight through air in the gravity well of a planet, but they are able to push against and glide through the ether, allowing travel through the space between worlds.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [In Lovecraft's stories, the glyphs in the <em>Necronomicon</em> are said to be quite distinctive; can I find “authentic” samples for use for Far Realm-type societies?]
    </p>

  <h2>The Ethereal Plane</h2>
    <p>
      … Does not exist.  Some creatures and objects can have the property of <em>being</em> “ethereal”, meaning that they are incorporeal, possibly invisible, etc., but it does not exist as an independent plane.  [There's not much reason the Inner Planes can't contact the Prime directly.  Also, it's weird to have two transitory planes, the Astral and the Ethereal, both coexisting with the Prime, but neither with the other.  They also shared many other properties, like movement by act of will, and a slowing of effective time.  If you just move demiplanes and assorted extraplanar effects to the Astral, you no longer need the Ethereal, as demonstrated by it having been removed entirely in 4e.  Sure, Planescape had a Guide to the Ethereal Plane, but I seriously doubt there's much in there that couldn't be dropped in elsewhere.]
    </p>

  <h2>The Inner Planes</h2>
    <p>
      Where the Astral and Outer Planes are planes of thought and belief, the Inner Planes are planes of substance and essence.  They are the ultimate sources of Positive and Negative Energy and the assorted material Elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      In their purest form, most of these planes are entirely inhospitable to most living beings.  (Even the Positive Energy Plane, the so-called Plane of Life, will fill every living cell with a surplus of energy until it bursts.)  Some are not (such as Air); the others can be survived with appropriate magical protections.  However, portions of these planes are “near” the Prime Material Plane, even coexisting with portions of Prime worlds at key points.  This means that a traveler can easily (even accidentally) cross over between the Prime and a nearby Inner Plane at certain locations.  For example, a faerie ring deep in the forest may take you to the Faewild, while a volcano likely contains a link to the Plane of Magma.  As each Inner Plane is a concentration and distillation of substance and essence that is usually much more sparse on the Prime, distances through these elemental planes are usually much shorter.  A savvy traveler could make use of interplanar coexistence points and local planar geography to travel from one part of the world to another, or even to a different world entirely, by stepping into one of these planes.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, with proper protections and the correct technique, a traveler might enter a volcano, pass into the Plane of Magma, navigate a moderate distance to another outlet from Magma, and emerge in another volcano miles (or parsecs!) from the first.  Much easier, however, might be to pass through a more hospitable plane, like Water or Air.  These present their own difficulties, of course—not the least of which being the problem of finding a crossover point in the middle of a vast ocean with no discernable landmarks!  And then there are the sea monsters….  You get the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can probably see by now, while the nearby regions of Inner Planes <em>can</em> be used as a fast means of travel, there are sufficient risks involved that this is not generally recommended.  All else being equal, if you have the means, the Astral Plane is probably a much safer and easier way to get from one location on the Prime to another.  (Also much more convenient, as these elemental planar touchpoints are not exactly commonplace: The wildest parts at the core of the largest forests might coexist with the Faewild, but other touchpoints, like faerie circles, tend to be small and short-lived.  The deepest, darkest caverns might provide passage to Earth, and as mentioned, the heart of a volcano probably leads to Magma, but these places are hard to reach.  And of course, the parts of the sea farthest from land, over the deepest parts of the ocean, where few ships dare to sail, might lead to the nearby part of Water, a sea of infinite expanse—from which you can sail to a sea on any other world, if you can navigate accurately!  Etc.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, these planes also contain worthwhile destinations of their own, such as the Gloomwrought, the City of Midnight, in the Shadowfell, the various faerie demesnes in the Faewild, the City of Brass in the Plane of Fire, and so forth.  A number of powerful beings make their homes in the Inner Planes.  Thinking of them as “flyover territory” is a mistake, for many reasons!
    </p>

    <h3>The Geometry of the Inner Planes</h3>
      <p>
        It is important to bear in mind that the fixed, reliable, predictable nature of space, as we understand it, is pretty much unique to the Prime Material Plane.  As noted elsewhere, the Outer Planes are realms of thought and belief; distances are based on conceptual similarity and concordance.  If two towns in the Outlands, say, become more similar in their cultures, morals, and ethics, they will find the “distance” between them to be shrinking.  Similarly, in the Inner Planes, large-scale distances are down to similarities or differences in substance and essence, as those are the key features there.  (You can find illustrations showing the Inner Planes in a spherical or cubical arrangement, but such things should be interpreted as roughly diagrammatic of relationships, not indicative of actual physical geometry.  If adhered to strictly, one quickly encounters difficulty.  This is made all the more clear by the fact that the names and compositions of these planes, and their arrangements, have not at all remained stable throughout the history of the game!)  [Note that I am also dropping the Para- and Quasi- business, as it is inconsistent, unwieldy, and ultimately unnecessary.  We can have as many or as few elemental planes as we wish.  Prime scholars may speak of the four primary elements of Air, Earth, Fire, and Water, which mix with each other and/or Energy planes to produce secondary elements, but don't use the term “secondary” within earshot of a denizen of one of those less famous planes!]
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, while each plane is infinite in at least one direction, containing unlimited quantities of its fundamental substance or essence, it is also possible to travel from any of these places to any other by moving in the “direction” of the appropriate element (though not all pairs of planes border each other directly).  Loosely speaking, you can think of the Prime as being a sort of metaphysical or higher-dimensional sphere surrounding the Inner Planes.  At the inner core are the pure planes themselves.  As you move outward, though, things become increasingly Prime-like, to the point that near the outer edges, you pretty consistently have discernable terrain and geography where the Air-like elements meet the Earth- or Water-like elements.  Generally speaking, in these outer areas, up is in the direction of Air or Fire, and down is in the direction of Earth or Water.  (At least, this is so near the “surface” of the more Prime-like regions: you can walk from the Faewild through the charred lands of Fire into the Shadowfell, or sail across the surface of the Water between the shores of those two lands.  Far above or below this surface, however, gravity gets weaker, until in the deepest depths of Earth or Water, or the greatest heights of Air or Fire, there is no sense of “up” or “down” at all!)  Wherever you are, you can move in the direction of a nearby element, or further “in” or “out”.  See the descriptions of the individual planes for more information on their composition, geography, and nearby elements.
      </p>

    <h3>The Faewild</h3>
      <p>
        Somewhere between the Positive and Prime lies a region commonly called the Faewild.  Here, life is more abundant, magic is more powerful, colors are brighter and more vibrant, and light is more intense.  Indeed, it is difficult to find anyplace truly dark on this plane.  At night, the sky is so full of stars that a dim light persists, even penetrating the forest canopy; most underground caverns have luminescent fungi or algae or the like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the Faewild is filled with lush green forests and rolling, grassy hills, and as the name suggests, this is the home of the fae.  (Originally, at any rate.  Some beings of fae heritage have long made their homes elsewhere, such as the elves of the Prime and the eladrin of Arborea.)  Do not make the mistake of confusing light and life with “good”, however: the fair folk are notorious for following moral codes that are seemingly <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">orthogonal</a> to human moral and ethical systems.  Travelers through forests and grasslands are advised to exercise caution when crossing hedgerows, avoid rings of mushrooms at all costs, and just generally stick to the known paths when possible, lest you accidentally find yourself <em>someplace else</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The coast of the Faewild borders the cleanest, clearest, freshest parts of the surface of Water.  Traveling further inland can instead take you to the great sparkling Mineral fields, the lava plains sitting atop Magma, or the scorching expanse of the outer parts of Fire.  Burrowing can take you into Mineral or Earth.  With flight, you can also move in the directions of Air, Radiance, Lightning, or Steam.  If you walk or fly in the direction of greatest brightness, you will find that Radiance converging with Lightning, Steam, and Minerals to lead to the Positive Energy Plane itself.
      </p>

    <h3>The Shadowfell</h3>
      <p>
        The Shadowfell is a dark, gloomy place that lies between the Negative and Prime Planes.  Colors are muted, light is dim, and even emotions are dampened.  Death and undeath are prominent forces here, so while most of the landscape is not openly hostile, many of its denizens are.  Nevertheless, as with the Faewild, “good” and “evil” are not particularly relevant concepts here; the shadar-kai, for instance, are a fae people bound to this plane, and not all are as dark of heart as they may appear.  [Try to merge the 3e and 4e versions somehow?]  Ancient ruins, forgotten graveyards, dead forests, and other such regions are the most likely places to find the boundary between the Prime and the Shadowfell to be weakened.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps the most famous (and feared) location in the Shadowfell is the Domain of Dread, a mist-shrouded demiplane governed by dark and mysterious Powers that serves as a kind of twisted prison for many of the most vile mortals—and, unfortunately, many non-vile mortals who are ensnared incidentally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traveling across land, you will find the Shadowfell to be mostly surrounded by vast plains of ash, dust, salt, and/or ice, depending on the direction you take.  In some places, you can find a coast that gives way to dark, murky, filthy brine, at the boundary of Water.  Flight or burrowing can take you into Air or Earth, respectively.  If you set off in the direction of the deepest darkness, however, you will find the air getting thinner and colder, gravity getting weaker, and the ground getting less and less solid, as Ash, Dust, and Vacuum all converge on you and you approach the Negative Energy Plane itself.
      </p>

    <h3>The Plane of Fire</h3>
      <p>
        [Stuff about the inner, pure parts of the plane, but also the outer, more habitable parts, where the ground is hot coals, the air is filled with smoke and sparks, etc.  Not immediately deadly, though it will cause you harm pretty quickly if you lack adequate protection.  Walking can take you deeper in, where you can find the City of Brass, for instance, or you can walk in the direction of fields of Magma or Ash.  Flight can take you deeper into Smoke, or you can skirt through it, veering quickly toward Air; alternatively, you can head toward Radiance.]
      </p>

    <h3>The Plane of Ash</h3>
      <p>
        [From here, you can walk toward Fire, as the ashes and embers under your feet grow warmer; or, you can veer toward Magma or Dust on a path toward Earth.  You can also trek into the Shadowfell, or instead turn away from the warmth and light, taking a path on which the air and the ashy ground alike become colder and thinner, headed more directly toward the Negative Energy Plane.]
      </p>

    <h3>The Plane of Water</h3>
      <p>
        The outermost portion of this plane shares a boundary with some of the outer parts of Air, creating the surface of an infinite sea.  Creatures or objects can swim or sail at this surface much as they would in a large body of water on a Prime world.  Some directions will take you to the muddy shores of Ooze; travel in brighter, warmer directions will see the water getting ever cleaner, clearer, and fresher, as you head toward the Faewild and Steam.  Other directions will take you muck and brine as you approach the Shadowfell and Salt, or into colder and colder waters with larger and more frequent icebergs as you approach Ice.  Flight will generally take you into the Air, unless you're far enough in the Positive direction to head into Steam.
      </p>

    <h3>Etc.</h3>
      <p>
        [I just put a few places here that I had specific ideas for.  I hope this illustrates the principles!]
