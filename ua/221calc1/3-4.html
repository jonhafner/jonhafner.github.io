<h1>Calculus I</h1>

<h2>§ 3.4: The Chain Rule</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Read the first two subsections carefully, in full.  (The third, “How to Prove the Chain Rule”, is a good view into some theory, but it’s more in-depth than we require here.  If you find it confusing, feel free to skip it.)
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–84
</p>
<p>
  Also read (and attempt if you like) the applications in exercises #85–92 and the important conceptual points in #95–98.
