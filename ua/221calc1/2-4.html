<h1>Calculus I</h1>

<h2>§ 2.4: The Precise Definition of a Limit</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Most of the section, particularly the first portion, from the beginning up until Example 2.  (Hold off on the subsection called “The Limit Laws” until you’ve seen at least part of § 2.3.  Similarly, if trying some of the harder exercises, delay #40 and 44 until then.)<!-- Obviously, this parenthetical note was added when I swapped the order of these two sections; remove it if swapping back. -->

<p>
  It’s very important to learn the <em>ideas</em> of this section; however, a significant portion of this section is devoted to formal proofs that are more abstract than most modern students are prepared for.  We no longer emphasize those as much as we once did.  If you are able to understand them, that’s fantastic—and I’ll be happy to answer questions, of course.  But you will not be responsible for constructing such proofs yourself.  Examples 2–5, and basically anything that says “prove” or “proof”, are semi-optional.  Try to follow along with the general reasoning if you can, but don’t worry if it’s too difficult for you at the moment.  You can always come back to this later on (whether during or after the semester) if you want to refine your understanding.
