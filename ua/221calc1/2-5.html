  Exercises #71 and 72 are valuable to consider in sequence.  The former is commonly known as the Dirichlet function.  After you have explored both of those, you may wish to take a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomae%27s_function">Thomae’s function</a>, which is discontinuous at all rational numbers, but continuous at all irrational numbers!  (Functions with such bizarre, nonintuitive properties we sometimes call “pathological”.  Don’t worry—most of the functions we encounter in study and practice are much more well-behaved.)

  Exercise #75 is a classic “real world” (if you can call it that) application/<wbr>illustration of the IVT.  Another classic example is the observation that, at any given time, there are two points on the border of Ohio (for instance) directly opposite each other with exactly the same air temperature.  I recommend thinking about both of these examples until you understand them.

  Exercise #76 would also be worthwhile to explore and consider.
