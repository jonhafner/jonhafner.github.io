<h1>Calculus I</h1>

<h2>§ 5.3: The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</h2>
<p>
  This astonishingly powerful theorem lives up to its grandiose name.  Read this section carefully!  I work through several examples in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5JPoye7WVg">§ 5.3a: FTC1 examples</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV9BWvGnvZE">§ 5.3b: FTC2 examples</a>.
</p>
<p>
  There’s a brief discussion of notation in the text between Examples 5 and 6.  In my experience, the “other common notations” are more common than the one Stewart primarily uses.  Personally, I feel that the lone right bracket ] feels unbalanced.  The version with the vertical bar | is a natural extension of other uses of that symbol, and it’s quick and easy to write, so I tend to favor it when it applies to an expression with only a single term.  When the function being evaluated has more than one term, I tend to use the paired brackets […], so as to properly enclose the whole thing.  However, this is just a set of personal preferences; you are certainly free to use Stewart’s notation if you prefer.
