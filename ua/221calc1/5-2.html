<h1>Calculus I</h1>

<h2>§ 5.2: The Definite Integral</h2>
<p>
  This section introduces the notation and terminology of the definite integral to extend the ideas of the previous section and make it easier to discuss and manipulate those concepts.  Many questions in this section rely mostly or entirely on skills from § 5.1; if you have not yet, see my previous videos for discussion of how to evaluate Riemann sums and their limits.  What follows will focus on the strictly new material.
</p>
<p>
  Observe that Definition 2 assigns language and notation to the central object of the previous section, specifically the version where we consider the limit as the number of subdivisions grows without bound.
  To make sense of this new thing called a “definite integral”, observe that it and the summation have analogous structures.
  Starting in the middle, the integrand <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) represents the evaluation of the function at a sample point, <i>f</i>(<i>x<sub>i</sub>*</i>).
  The <i>dx</i> is a differential, which we have seen previously is often used to stand in for Δ<i>x</i> when the latter approaches zero.
  Before, that was in the context of derivatives, but here, it’s the lengths of the subintervals (and the widths of their corresponding approximating rectangles) that are shrinking to zero.
  Continuing that trend of replacing Greek letters in the discrete case with their Latin equivalents in the continuous limits, the Greek Σ is replaced with the Latin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_s">long s</a>, both standing for “sum”.
  So, while not strictly rigorous, we can intuitively think of the integral as describing a sum of an infinite number of infinitesimal quantities, which are the function values each multiplied by the differential <i>dx</i>.
  Keeping that interpretation in mind can assist your understanding of the properties, behavior, and applications of integrals in the future.
</p>
<p>
  The “Notes” that follow the definition are very important; read them carefully.  However, I have a remark and a correction to make:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Note 1</strong> states that “For now, the symbol <i>dx</i> has no meaning by itself”.  Setting aside the informal, non-rigorous interpretation I offered above, this is essentially correct.  However, the key phrase there is “For now”: it will have a great deal of meaning later!  In § 5.5, we will see how treating it as a proper differential can greatly aid our bookkeeping when performing a change of variables.  In Calculus III, the differentials of integrals will become <em>extremely</em> important.  (If you’d like a preview of that, glance at some random pages in Chapters 15 and 16.)  In the past, I’ve noticed that some students omit the differential at the end when writing integrals; <strong>do not do this</strong>.  Aside from being blatantly incorrect notation, such omission weakens the conceptual ties, and also starts a bad habit that will set you up for a great deal of pain in future courses.  Form good habits now and always include the differential in every integral you write!
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In the eBook, <strong>Note 3</strong> contains a typographical error: that integral sign should not be inside the sum!  The sum should exactly match the expression inside the limit in the definition.  (The printed version of the textbook and electronic duplications thereof have the correct expression.)
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Read the rest of this section carefully; again, refer to my videos from the previous section for the portions that rehash or extend those topics.  For the new notations and concepts, here are a few videos with several examples:
