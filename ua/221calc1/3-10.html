<h1>Calculus I</h1>

<h2>§ 3.10: Linear Approximations and Differentials</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.  Keep in mind that the linearization is simply the tangent line at the point in question, obtained from the point-slope formula.  There is no need to use Equation 1 directly unless you wish to.  (Some of you may find it convenient or otherwise useful, but if you find it more confusing or cumbersome than helpful, just find the tangent line through the means you prefer.)
