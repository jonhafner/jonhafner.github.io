<h2>§ 5.5: The Substitution Rule</h2>
<p>
  The substitution rule, also called a “change of variable”, is essentially a reversal of the Chain Rule.  It tends to be particularly useful when we wish to integrate something that involves a composition of functions, though it has other applications as well.  This is a very powerful technique, but it’s also a bit tricky and subtle, and it can take some practice.  Integration is sometimes a bit of an art.  You’ll want to consume as many examples as possible and try as many exercises as you can.  Read this section carefully, and I also work through additional examples in
