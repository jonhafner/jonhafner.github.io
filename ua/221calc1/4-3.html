<h1>Calculus I</h1>

<h2>§ 4.3: What Derivatives Tell Us about the Shape of a Graph</h2>
<p>
  Up front, I should mention that several tasks in this section are easiest with some sort of “sign chart”.  There are different styles of such charts, and most people tend to find that there’s one they most prefer.  The examples in the text use tables, and these are very thorough and precise, but some people find them cumbersome.  I personally use diagrams based on number lines: they are more compact and visually suggestive, albeit somewhat abstract.  I illustrate how those work in my video example (see below).  Feel free to use whatever bookkeeping and organizational method works best for you, whether one of these or another you find or create.
</p>
<p>
  Now then.  As usual, you should read this section thoroughly; here are the big ideas, so they don’t get lost in the details:
</p>
<p>
  You already know that a differentiable function has a positive derivative where it’s increasing and a negative derivative where it’s decreasing.  The first subsection formalizes that.
</p>
<p>
  The second derivative describes how the first derivative changes, which in turn describes how the original function “bends”.  If <i>f″</i> is positive, the graph of <i>f</i> bends upward and lies above its tangent lines; we say that <i>f</i> is concave upward there.  If <i>f″</i> is negative, the graph of <i>f</i> bends downward and lies below its tangent lines; we say that <i>f</i> is concave downward there.  A point where the graph switches concavity is called an inflection point.  (In general, if a tangent line exists at an inflection point, it will cross the graph there, being above on one side and below on the other.)
</p>
<p>
  The First and Second Derivative Tests are two methods of identifying local extrema.  Both are important.  In any given problem, you will usually only need one or the other, rarely both.  However, in most cases, one will be much easier to apply than the other, depending on the particular problem.  Make sure you learn and practice both.  (Usually, the First Derivative Test will be easier than the Second, but not always.  However, you will see in Calculus III that with multivariate functions, the First is useless, and we must instead use an extension of the Second; see § 14.7 if you’re curious.)

  I illustrate most of the main points of this section in my example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XfPHgGMMpw">§ 4.3: Exercise #24</a>.
