<h1>Calculus I</h1>

<h2>Preliminaries</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Background:</strong> In principle, we expect you to be familiar with the content of all previous courses up through Precalculus.  Realistically, I am aware that many of you will have assorted gaps—sometimes because you have forgotten things you haven’t used in a while, or perhaps sometimes because certain topics were missed during your particular course of education.  However, that awareness does not get us around the fact that you’ll need to find and remedy any such gaps in order to succeed in this course.
</p>
<p>
  A review of much (though not all) of the expected background material can be found in the textbook in Appendices A–E and Chapter 1.  (Some of the messier trigonometric and summation identities are not required to be memorized; if anything in there looks intimidating, check with me to verify whether you’ll be responsible for it.)
</p>
<p>
  Consider trying the Diagnostic Tests on pp. xxvi–xxx in the front matter of the textbook; each test is followed immediately by its answers so you can check your work.  If you have trouble with anything there, that suggests topics for review.  (I believe the eBook version actually links you directly to the related review topics, conveniently.)
</p>
<p>
  Also, Dr. Norfolk’s <a href="rev149.pdf">review of algebra and precalculus</a> has a good sampling of some of the things you should remember from previous coursework.  Solutions to the exercises are on pages 4–6, and reminders of some useful techniques are on pages 7–8.
</p>
<p>
  The last couple sections of Chapter 1 contain material that you technically should have seen in previous courses, but my experience is that many of you may be less familiar with some of it.  I’ll address several issues of particular concern in class, but we won’t have time to go over everything in depth.  I suggest you read these sections carefully.
