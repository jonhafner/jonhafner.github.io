<h1>Calculus I</h1>

<h2>§ 2.3: Calculating Limits Using the Limit Laws</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.
</p>
<p>
  You will need to learn these Limit Laws, but you are <strong>not</strong> expected to memorize their numbers!  We cite them by number in some examples and exercises at the beginning, as it is very useful to initially be very careful about which law you’re applying when.  Over time, with practice, you should reach the point where you have internalized these laws so you can apply them almost automatically.
</p>
<p>
  Pay attention to the requirements and conditions on these laws!  The component limits must exist, the limit of a denominator cannot be zero, etc.  If you are not attentive to such matters, you might try to apply them in situations where they are not valid, and draw incorrect conclusions as a result.
</p>
<p>
  Take note of the remark associated with Example 10 (at the end of the example in the eBook, a neighboring margin note in the printed text); in my experience, the latter notation and name are more common in the modern mathematical literature.  This function is rarely encountered at this level except in special examples, but its application is more common in advanced mathematics, as well as even some relatively basic computer applications.  For more on this function and its counterpart, the “least integer” or “ceiling” function, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions">this Wikipedia article</a>.

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–34, 37–54
</p>
<p>
  We did most of #49 as an example in class, but not part (iv).  Consider this for yourself, and compare it to part (iii).
