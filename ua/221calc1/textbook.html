<h1>Calculus I</h1>

<h2>Textbook and WebAssign</h2>

<p>
  The textbook will be your primary resource for this course.  It’s packed with useful information, illustrations, examples, and references.  I will post notes to help guide you through the readings, and the bulk of my lectures will be designed to supplement (with additional examples) or complement (with alternate viewpoints) the textbook; I cannot replace it.  I myself learned calculus from 3rd edition Stewart, and its modern descendants are even more thorough and extensive.  This text isn’t perfect, but it is the best one I’ve seen.  (Or at least, its <em>content</em> is, as is its printed form; I readily admit that the presentation of the online eBook version is … not optimal.  See below for other options.)
</p>

<h3>WebAssign</h3>
<p>
  The eBook is only one portion of a broader system called WebAssign, which includes a variety of assessment tools and other resources.  This semester, I am not attaching any sort of points or grades to anything in WebAssign; it is a <strong>strictly optional</strong> resource.  Feel free to use it as much or as little as you please.  I have activated the premade “assignments” that were provided by the publisher, if you find such things helpful.  (I must stress that those were put together by Cengage, not by myself or anyone else at UAkron.  If a question seems particularly strange to you, feel free to check with me to confirm how relevant it is to our course.)  In addition to those assessments, it also has an extensive library of videos and other resources.
</p>

<h3>Access to WebAssign and the eBook</h3>
<p>
  As described in the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a>, if you are registered in this course, you should have access to a digital copy of the textbook via WebAssign.  When you log into <a href="https://brightspace.uakron.edu">Brightspace</a> and navigate to this course, you should see a panel in the left sidebar called “Content Browser”.  One link reads “Ebook and WebAssign access”; if you click that, it should expand into a collection of links through which you can access the eBook, WebAssign, and tech support.  (If you aren’t able to get to the eBook from here, first make sure you have disabled your browser’s pop-up blocker for this site.  If it still doesn’t work, consult the resources listed below, then contact tech support if necessary.)

  For more information about this arrangement, see <a href="InclusiveAccess.pdf">this document</a> supplied by our department a couple years ago; for more current instructions on getting started in WebAssign, see <a href="https://startstrong.cengage.com/webassign-brightspace-ia-yes/">this guide</a>.  For technical assistance, consult the <a href="https://www.cengage.com/help-center/">Cengage help and support center</a>.  Our Cengage representative will also be hosting some “office hours” on Zoom for any UAkron students who have questions on how to register.

<h3>Opting out of Inclusive Access</h3>
<p>
  There are a couple situations in which you might want to opt out of this arrangement to recover the fee charged to you.  First and foremost, if you already have access through some other means, such as a Cengage Unlimited subscription, you should probably opt out of this program to avoid paying extra.
</p>
<p>
  You might also wish to opt out if you already have a copy of the textbook or are able to find one at a good price, and you are not particularly interested in the eBook’s video examples and the other resources WebAssign offers.  See below for my recommendations on which editions of the textbook will serve your needs.
</p>
<p>
  If you do wish to opt out, see the statement in the syllabus and the referenced website for more information.
</p>

<h3>Textbook Versions</h3>
<p>
  The assigned textbook for this course is <em>Calculus: Early Transcendentals</em>, 9th Edition, by James Stewart et&nbsp;al., published by Cengage Learning.  A digital “eBook” version is available through WebAssign, as described above, but if your only access is digital, I would personally recommend picking up a physical copy of the text for convenience.  (The print version also has superior layout and typography and fewer errors.)
</p>
<p>
  A looseleaf “custom edition” should be available in our bookstore; I believe this omits the chapters not included in our Calculus sequence, but I am not aware of any other significant differences.  If you prefer a hardcover, you can seek a copy elsewhere.  Used copies may be much cheaper, but be warned that if they are not the latest edition, some details will differ, such as exercises and section numbers.  The further back you go, the more “drift” you can expect.  I do <em>not</em> recommend buying a copy that does not say “Early Transcendentals” on the cover.  (Actually, I prefer the standard version personally, but since the material is so heavily rearranged in ET, and that’s what our curriculum is based around, you are likely to find it terribly confusing.)
