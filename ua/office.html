<h1>Office: CAS 246</h1>

<p>My office is located in a connecting hallway near the back of the Math and CS wing of the second floor of the College of Arts and Sciences.  Students who are not already familiar with that space tend to get lost, so for your first trip to my office, I would strongly suggest that as soon as you exit the stairs or elevator on the second floor, you take a look at the map on the north wall, next to the Computer Science department office.  My name is not on the list, but you should be able to locate my office by its number much more quickly and easily than the alternative approach, which is to wander the halls and become bewildered by the sudden jumps in office numbers!</p>
