<h1>Calculus I</h1>

<h2>§ 4.9: Antiderivatives</h2>
<p>
  Antiderivatives are extremely useful and important; read this section carefully.  Note that no general notation is introduced here for designating the antiderivative of a function.  For convenience, if a function has a lowercase name, we tend to label its antiderivative with the capital of that letter, but <em>do not</em> attach too much weight to that!  If you see some application with functions called, say, <i>g</i> and <i>G</i>, do not assume <i>G′</i> = <i>g</i> unless you are told so!  We will get a notation for this in Chapter 5, once we have some justification for it.
</p>
<p>
  In this section, you are only asked to find antiderivatives of relatively simple functions, which you should be able to recognize as derivatives of known functions with little or no manipulation.  Table 2 of antidifferentiation formulae shouldn’t be surprising if you read it “backwards”.  If you know your derivative rules well, you should have little trouble here.  Perhaps the weirdest one at first glance might be the power rule, but if you think of differentiating a power as a two-step process—multiply by the power, then reduce it by 1—the antiderivative is just the reverse: increase the power by 1, then divide by the new power.  This works as long as the power is not −1, where that rule would yield division by zero; that’s where the natural logarithm comes to our rescue.

  I work through several examples in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkHC6YOfDCA">§ 4.9a: Four quick antiderivatives</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t98DzDxG7A0">§ 4.9b: Initial value problem (Exercise #68)</a>.
</p>
<p>
  See also Exercise #72, with a formula most of you have probably encountered before.  Working through the process of developing it is likely to make it easier to remember, and if you ever do forget it, you now have the tools to easily reobtain it if needed!
