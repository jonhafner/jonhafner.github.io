<h1>Calculus I</h1>

<h2>§ 4.5: Summary of Curve Sketching</h2>
<p>
  As discussed in the introduction to this section, while graphing utilities are extremely useful, they also have significant limitations and must be used intelligently.  This section explores how we can use what we know about analyzing functions to identify all the key features of a graph ourselves.  In practice, we usually combine these methods with the use of a calculator or computer to ensure we obtain a picture that is both complete and accurate; for more on the techniques of such joint analysis, see the next section in the textbook.  (We skip § 4.6 in our curriculum, but I strongly recommend taking a look at it when you have the time!)
</p>
<p>
  You certainly do not need to memorize the list of items A–H!  These are so labeled for convenient reference within this section; what you should retain long-term is an awareness and understanding of these various features and how to find them.
</p>
<p>
  The only significant topic in this section that I expect might be new to many of you is that of “slant” or “oblique” asymptotes, discussed in the last subsection.  (We can even have <em>nonlinear</em> asymptotes; these are explored in exercises #78–80.  Most generally, we can say that if <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) − <i>g</i>(<i>x</i>) → 0 as <i>x</i> → ±∞, then <i>y</i> = <i>g</i>(<i>x</i>) is an asymptote of <i>f</i>.)

  These methods apply to a tremendous variety of functions; for just two examples to illustrate a few key points, I’ve worked through a simple polynomial in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flDrnOdreEE">§ 4.5a: Exercise #6</a> and a more serious rational function in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnfdg3wv9og">§ 4.5b: Exercise #70</a>.  (The latter includes a slant asymptote.)
