<h1>Calculus I</h1>

<h2>§ 4.7: Optimization Problems</h2>
<p>
  This section introduces no new mechanical techniques, but rather explores practical applications of the methods from previous sections for finding extrema of functions.  The text offers some suggested steps for approaching these, but it is not required that you follow them precisely; if you are comfortable with word problems in general, you can approach them as you see fit.  I work through a few examples here:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKOlSJZD59E">§ 4.7a: Exercise #2</a></p></li>
  <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx4lbkLWa2Q">§ 4.7b: Exercise #12</a></p></li>
  <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z3W3ERAEBY">§ 4.7c: Exercise #26</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>
  As always, read the text for more examples.  There are certain “classic” examples of optimization problems; for instance, Example 1 is a classic fence problem (though it is more traditional to have one side up against a barn rather than a river), Example 2 is a larger version of the classic soup can problem (explaining why most food cans have the same proportions), and Example 4 is equivalent to the classic lifeguard problem (in which a lifeguard seeks to reach a drowning swimmer as quickly as possible).
