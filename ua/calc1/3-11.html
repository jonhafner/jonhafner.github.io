<h1>Calculus I</h1>

<h2>§ 3.11: Hyperbolic Functions</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  We generally handle hyperbolic functions with a pretty light touch.  Certainly read the first subsection, “Hyperbolic Functions and Their Derivatives”, but the second subsection, “Inverse Hyperbolic Functions and Their Derivatives”, is less essential.  We’ll circle back to the relevant portions of that subsection later.
