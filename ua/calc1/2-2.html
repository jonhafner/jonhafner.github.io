<h1>Calculus I</h1>

<h2>§ 2.2: The Limit of a Function</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.  Pay special attention to the discussion following Example 1 and the content of Examples 3 and 5.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>NB:</strong> In the eBook, right after Definition 1, there’s an interactive resource called “Explore It: Graphical Idea of a Limit”.  I actually do <em>not</em> recommend going through that; in my opinion, they choose poor examples, and the interactive component is difficult to use.  I think it would be more confusing than helpful—stick to the text in this case.
</p>
<p>
  If you have time, read the short supplement “<a href="http://www.stewartcalculus.com/data/default/upfiles/Calc_8ET_liesmycomp_stu.pdf">Lies My Calculator and Computer Told Me</a>”.  That document used to be included in earlier editions of the textbook as an appendix, and it discusses some very important points that every scientist and engineer needs to be aware of.  Portions of that section deal with topics from later in this course or the next, so skip over anything you aren’t familiar with for now, and perhaps return later on in your studies.  The main lesson to extract at the moment is that computers and calculators are a tremendous aid, but we cannot put perfect trust in the numbers and graphs they produce!  Their limitations are among the reasons we still need to learn how to perform rigorous, precise analysis ourselves.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–12, 15–18, 29–45
</p>
<p>
  #19–28 are also good exercises, but only if you can automate the process.  Enter the function into your calculator, then ask it to evaluate the function at each of the desired values.  (In the TI-80-series, you can do this with a table in “Ask” mode, or on a graph by typing in <i>x</i>-values and hitting Enter to get the corresponding <i>y</i>-values.  Consult your manual and/or check with me if you have difficulties.)
</p>
<p>
  <strong>NB:</strong> In the eBook, exercise #7(c) contains an error: the first “<i>g</i>(<i>x</i>)” is actually supposed to be the limit of <i>g</i>(<i>x</i>) as <i>x</i> approaches <i>a</i> from the left.  (The physical printing of the textbook is correct.)
</p>
<p>
  My colleagues and I have not read the eBook thoroughly, for the most part; we’ve caught some errors ourselves, but most have been found by our students.  If you see anything that looks strange or doesn’t make sense to you, ask me about it!  It may be an error, or there may be something you don’t understand; either way, we should discuss it.
