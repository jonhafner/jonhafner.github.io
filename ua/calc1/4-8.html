<h1>Calculus I</h1>

<h2>§ 4.8: Newton’s Method</h2>
<p>
  Newton’s method is a powerful technique for numerically approximating solutions to equations, even those which cannot be solved analytically.  This is an important application, but a minor point in our curriculum, so I’m skipping it for the sake of time.  I encourage you to take a look when you get a chance, however, and if you’re interested in more such things, consider taking courses such as Applied Numerical Methods!

  If you try this out yourself, be aware that you should not use direct entry for any but the simplest of examples.  Entering each iteration into a calculator manually would be very tedious, so you should instead take advantage of the features of the software at your disposal.  For example, on a TI-83, 84, or 86, you might want to enter the original function into Y<sub>1</sub> and its derivative into Y<sub>2</sub>, for instance.  With that setup, you can then store your initial guess in the variable X using the “store” key (often marked “STO▶” or similar); for example, if you want to start at 1, you can enter “1→X” at the home screen.  From there, you can enter the iterative step as “X−Y<sub>1</sub>/Y<sub>2</sub>→X”.  This computes the next iterant and stores the new value back into X.  Once done, you should be able to repeatedly press ENTER to step through each iteration very quickly.  Test this on a textbook example to make sure it’s working, and let me know if you have any questions.  (Do note that different calculators and software packages may use very different syntax.  On a TI-89 or 92, the iterative step will probably look more like “x−y1(x)/y2(x)→x”.  Other CAS software might need something of the form “x=…” or “x:=…” instead.  Consult your manual or check with me if none of this works.)
