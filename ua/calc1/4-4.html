<h1>Calculus I</h1>

<h2>§ 4.4: Indeterminate Forms and l’Hospital’s Rule</h2>
<p>
  This section introduces a powerful technique that can be helpful when tackling certain kinds of limits.  Read it carefully.  Do not fall into the trap of leaping to l’Hospital’s Rule at every opportunity—if a limit can be evaluated using more elementary techniques, it is usually best to do so.  In particular, it’s generally considered poor style to apply l’Hospital’s Rule to rational functions, and it’s technically circular reasoning to use it for the trigonometric limits we studied in § 3.3.  It’s usually most useful when a limit involves one or more transcendental functions (trig, log, exponential) and doesn’t fit into a form we know how to approach by other means.  Pay special attention to the warnings in Examples 1 and 5, as these call out common errors.  And even when it does apply, sometimes it doesn’t help at all, so you have to apply other techniques; I illustrate at least one such case in my first video, below.  L’Hospital’s Rule is extremely useful in certain situations, but it’s just one tool in your metaphorical toolbox.

  Note that any time the textbook applies l’Hospital’s Rule in the examples, it cites the rule by name.  This is partly to help explain to the student what’s going on, but it’s also because if it’s unexpected, the reader might have difficulty figuring out what happened.  (In particular, it has a tendency to look like very bad algebra if the reader doesn’t realize what’s going on.)  For this reason, you should <em>always</em> indicate when you’re appling the rule.  Writing it out by name can be cumbersome; a common convention is to simply write “H” or “l’H” or something similar above the equals sign in the step where the rule is applied.  (I’ll demonstrate this in my examples.)

  I work through <em>several</em> examples in the two videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Olltt551sE">§ 4.4a: Indeterminate quotients</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCWkoe6Br6c">§ 4.4b: Other indeterminate forms</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Also, a couple lessons from the textbook exercises: #75–76 are good things to know as mathematically educated people, and #77–78 are examples of other situations in which l’Hospital is powerless and other techniques must be applied.
