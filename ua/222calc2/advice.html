<h1>Calculus II</h1>

<h2>Expectations and advice</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Expectations and preparation:</strong>  We expect that you are fully capable with all material from the main sequence: arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and Calculus I.  In particular, you will need to be able to quickly and accurately apply the standard techniques of differentiation and integration.  You will need to be able to differentiate all the standard basic functions, as well as their products, quotients, and compositions.  You will also need to be able to integrate common functions and apply basic integration techniques such as substitution.  Make sure you review any topics you think might give you trouble, and ask me questions if you encounter difficulties.
</p>
<p>
  Our textbook can obviously serve as a review of previous calculus material, but it also includes reviews of pre-calculus topics in Appendices A–D and Chapter&nbsp;1.  If you think you might be rusty on any of these topics, or have missed one or two points in your previous education, you might wish to give them a skim and watch out for anything you are less familiar with.
</p>
<p>
  (Tangentially related, a topic that <em>used</em> to be covered in an appendix in earlier editions but has since been relegated to an online supplement is “<a href="https://stewartcalculus.com/_update/media/common/liesmycomp_stu.pdf">Lies My Calculator and Computer Told Me</a>”.  This short document explores some very important points to keep in mind whenever using technology to assist our calculations, and I strongly recommend reading it at your earliest convenience.)
</p>
<p>
  A colleague of mine has posted her Tech Math lectures on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/UAMath2030/playlists">organized into playlists</a>.  I haven’t watched many of these myself yet, but you may find some of them helpful; in particular, several playlists pertain to exponentials, logarithms, or trigonometry.  (Note that section numbers are for their textbook, not ours.)  If you try these out, please let me know if you have any feedback.
</p>
<p>
  For extra practice with Calc-I-style integrals, see <a href="Practice-Integration.pdf">this handout</a> distributed by a previous coördinator.  (Answers are on the second page, but one of them contains a minor error; can you find it?)
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Advice:</strong> One of the best things you can do early on is to carefully read and consider Dr. Kreider’s advice for <a href="../success.pdf">Being Prepared For Calculus</a>.  (It was written for his Calculus I class, but I feel it applies to most mathematics courses at the 100–300 level.)
</p>
<!-- Above link used to be directly to his document at http://math.uakron.edu/~kreider/calc1/success.pdf, but the math server isn't working right now! -->
<!-- The following is edited for this summer class; see the 2025 Spring Calc3 version for a regular semester.  (But maybe incorporate some of my revisions to make it a little more concise?) -->
<p>
  The only thing I would add to that advice is some discussion of scheduling and pacing.  You may have heard the rule of thumb that you can generally expect to spend two to three hours outside of class for every hour you spend in class.  In our accelerated summer schedule, we have a little over six hours per week in class, so you can expect to need 12–18 hours per week for reading, homework, studying for tests, etc.  (Some of you may be able to get away with less, but some of you may need more!)  If you take one day a week “off” from math, that leaves an average of two to three hours per day on the remaining six days.
</p>
<p>
  That average is important to observe, since human brains tend to learn best in short-ish shifts; some experts advise 20 minutes, but in my experience, as your mathematical studies advance, it can feel like you’re barely digging in after such a short time!  You might find longer sessions to be more productive for you.  Just try to avoid making them <em>too</em> long.  There’s often a limit to how much new material you can cram into your head at once; your brain needs some time to “digest” new ideas, so taking a break after a while to do other things—or even better, get some sleep—can help you form better memories and connections.  So, don’t wait until the last minute to start grinding out an assignment, leaving yourself with too little wiggle room: start homework as soon as you can, work on it frequently, and take breaks often.

  Most of the advice above can help you regardless of whether you’re having trouble and struggling to improve, or if you’re already doing well and want to do even better.  If you find yourself in that latter group, you may be seeking ways to further hone your skills and stretch your abilities.  I suggest first reading <em>all</em> of the exercises in the textbook and attempting any you find interesting, even if not on the “suggested” list.  Also take a look at the projects following some sections, and the “Problems Plus” sets after each chapter.  Additional challenge problems can be found on the main website for the textbook; last I checked, they don’t seem to have posted a 9th edition update yet, but <a href="https://www.stewartcalculus.com/data/default/upfiles/8et_challprobs_student.pdf">here are the challenge problems for the 8th</a>.
