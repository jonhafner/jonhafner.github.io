<h1>Calculus II</h1>

<h2>Textbook and WebAssign</h2>

<p>
  The textbook will be your primary resource for this course.  It’s packed with useful information, illustrations, examples, and references.  I will post notes to help guide you through the readings, and the bulk of my lectures will be designed to supplement (with additional examples) or complement (with alternate viewpoints) the textbook; I cannot replace it.  I myself learned calculus from 3rd edition Stewart, and its modern descendants are even more thorough and extensive.  This text isn’t perfect, but it is the best one I’ve seen.
</p>

<h3>WebAssign</h3>
<p>
  The eBook is only one portion of a broader system called WebAssign, which includes a variety of assessment tools and other resources.  This is where you’ll find the assignments described in my page about <a href="homework.html">Homework</a>.  In addition to those assessments, it also has an extensive library of videos and other resources.
</p>

<h3>Access to WebAssign and the eBook</h3>
<p>
  As described in the syllabus, if you are registered in this course, you should have access to a digital copy of the textbook via WebAssign.  You may need to first “verify” your “ALL-IN Book Bundle”.  Following are instructions from the bookstore on this topic:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>You must confirm your book order here:  <a href="https://www.uakron.edu/bookbundle/">https://www.uakron.edu/bookbundle/</a>.  Scroll down and then click “Verify Your Order”.</li>
    <li>Click the e-book link in Brightspace.</li>
    <li>You will be asked to complete registration, which you should do.  You do not need to pay.  You can now access the e-book and any other publisher resources available for this class.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    *If a student would like to opt out of the all-in bundle they can do so here:  <a href="https://www.uakron.edu/bookbundle">https://www.uakron.edu/bookbundle</a> scroll down to “can I opt-out of the program”. If the student opts out, they will be responsible for purchasing the material on their own through the bookstore (<a href="https://shopakronzips.com/">shopakronzips.com</a>).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Once that’s done, you should be able to access WebAssign.  When you log into <a href="https://brightspace.uakron.edu">Brightspace</a> and navigate to this course, you should see a panel in the left sidebar called “Content Browser”.  Under “Course Materials”, click “WebAssign and eBook”, then the link with our course name should launch WebAssign for this class.  (I’m sorry it’s buried so many levels deep—I have no control over that.)
