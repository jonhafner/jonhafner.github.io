<h1>Precalculus</h1>

<h2>Homework, textbook, and ALEKS</h2>

<p>The graded homework in this class is handled through an online system called ALEKS.  Access to this system is paid for through course fees, as part of the Inclusive Access program.  You can register in my ALEKS course through Brightspace using the directions found in <a href="https://www.mheducation.com/highered/support/aleks/first-day-of-class/ia-d2l-mhcampus.html">this video</a>.</p>

<p>You may find some of the resources on <a href="https://www.mheducation.com/highered/support/aleks/beyond.student-success-for-them.html">this page</a> to be useful.  Additionally, the coördinator has provided <a href="navigating-open-pie.pdf">this document (PDF)</a> with explanations of “Open Pie Mode” and “Review Mode”.  In particular, the coördinator wishes to stress that the “pie” and the “Knowledge Checks” <em>only</em> consist of prerequisite topics, not new material for Precalculus.  The proper homework assignments cover the actual Precalculus content.</p>

<p>Be sure to return to ALEKS frequently to work on assignments and stay on schedule.  In general, you should attempt new assignments as early as possible.  Among the many reasons for this is the fact that after the deadline for the assignment passes, you can return to it later for review, such as when preparing for an exam; however, if you never opened it before it was due, it will remain closed to you afterward.</p>

<p>ALEKS also provides access to an online version of the textbook.  If you would like a physical copy as well for your convenience, a discounted looseleaf copy is available at the University bookstore.</p>
