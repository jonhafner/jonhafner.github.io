<h1>ODE</h1>

<h2>Expectations and advice</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Expectations:</strong>  We expect that you are fully capable with all material from the main sequence: arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and Calculus I–III.  Particularly important here will be the ability to quickly and reliably differentiate and integrate a variety of functions.  Make sure you review any topics you think might give you trouble, and ask me questions if you encounter difficulties.  Some other instructors put together various review sheets you may find handy:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="CalculusFactsYouShouldKnow.pdf">Calculus Facts You Should Know</a></li>
  <li><a href="ReviewofIntegrationandTrigonometry.pdf">Review of Integration and Trigonometry</a></li>
  <li><a href="More_integration_review.pdf">More integration review</a></li>
  <li><a href="IntegrationReviewProblems.pdf">Integration Review Problems</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Advice:</strong> One of the best things you can do early on is to carefully read and consider Dr.&nbsp;Kreider’s advice for <a href="../success.pdf">Being Prepared For Calculus</a>.  (It was written for his Calculus I class, but I feel it applies to most mathematics courses at the 100–300 level.)  Also see the first portion of the Preface in our textbook, as Zill has some great advice as well!

<p>
  The only thing I would add to that advice is some discussion of scheduling and pacing.  You may have heard the rule of thumb that you can generally expect to spend two to three hours outside of class for every hour you spend in class.  That means that for a four-credit-hour class such as ours, you can expect to need eight to twelve hours per week for reading, homework, studying for tests, etc.  (Some of you may be able to get away with less, but some of you may need more!)  That averages out to about an hour or two per day.
</p>
<p>
  That average is important to observe, since human brains tend to learn best in short-ish shifts; some experts advise 20 minutes, but in my experience, as your mathematical studies advance, it can feel like you’re barely digging in after such a short time!  You might find something closer to 60–90 minutes at a time to be more productive for you, in which case you might want to aim for approximately one or two sessions per day, almost every day.  Keeping these at fixed, consistent times can be helpful, but even if not, simply spreading them out a bit helps.  There’s often a limit to how much new math you can cram into your head at once; your brain needs some time to “digest” new ideas, so taking a break after a while to do other things—or even better, get some sleep—can help you form better memories and connections.
</p>
<p>
  What you absolutely <em>do not</em> want to do is the opposite of this, trying to grind out an entire section or two’s worth of studying and homework on the day it’s due!  Much of what you try to learn probably isn’t going to make much sense, you’re likely to get stumped by some problems and not have the time to let them stew in the back of your head for a while, and even if you can manage to figure things out, you’re going to be tired and miserable after a marathon session of grinding through problem sets.  I personally understand the tendency to procrastinate all too well, so I completely sympathize if you find yourself suffering through this terrible experience anyway.  But if it’s at all possible to do so, you are likely to find your studies to be much more pleasant, efficient, and effective if you can spread them out across multiple sessions of reasonable length.

  Most of the advice above can help you regardless of whether you’re having trouble and struggling to improve, or if you’re already doing well and want to do even better.  If you find yourself in that latter group, you may be seeking ways to further hone your skills and stretch your abilities.  I suggest first reading <em>all</em> of the exercises in the textbook and attempting any you find interesting, even if not on the “suggested” list.  Also take a look at the sections we omit, as nearly all of them are useful and interesting, if only we had the time for them!
