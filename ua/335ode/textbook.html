<h1>ODE</h1>

<h2>Textbook</h2>

<p>
  The textbook will be your primary resource for this course.  It’s packed with useful information, illustrations, examples, and references.  The bulk of my lectures will be designed to supplement (with additional examples) or complement (with alternate viewpoints) the textbook; I cannot replace it.  I myself learned ODEs from 2nd edition Zill, and its modern descendants are even more thorough and extensive.  This text isn’t perfect, but it is the best one I’ve seen.
</p>

<h3>Access to the eBook</h3>
<p>
  As described in the syllabus, if you are registered in this course, you should have access to a digital copy of the textbook.  When you log into <a href="https://brightspace.uakron.edu">Brightspace</a> and navigate to this course, you should see a panel in the left sidebar called “Content Browser”.  One link reads “eBook access”; if you click that, it should bring you to a link through which you can register for and access the eBook.
</p>
<p>
  If you don’t have access through other means, you may need to first “verify” your “ALL-IN Book Bundle”.  Following are instructions from the bookstore on this topic:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>You must confirm your book order here:  <a href="https://www.uakron.edu/bookbundle/">https://www.uakron.edu/bookbundle/</a>.  Scroll down and then click “Verify Your Order”.</li>
    <li>Click the e-book link in Brightspace.</li>
    <li>You will be asked to complete registration, which you should do.  You do not need to pay.  You can now access the e-book and any other publisher resources available for this class.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    *If a student would like to opt out of the all-in bundle they can do so here:  <a href="https://www.uakron.edu/bookbundle">https://www.uakron.edu/bookbundle</a> scroll down to “can I opt-out of the program”. If the student opts out, they will be responsible for purchasing the material on their own through the bookstore (<a href="https://shopakronzips.com/">shopakronzips.com</a>).
  </p>

<h3>Opting out of the book bundle</h3>
<p>
  If you do not need the book bundle for your other classes, and you’re able to find a copy of our textbook for a decent price, you might wish to opt out, as explained above.  See below for my recommendations on which editions of the textbook will serve your needs.
</p>

<h3>Textbook Versions</h3>
<p>
  The assigned textbook for this course is <em>A First Course in Differential Equations with Modeling Applications</em>, 11th Edition, by Dennis G. Zill, published by Cengage Learning.  A digital “eBook” version is available as described above, but if your only access is digital, I would personally recommend picking up a physical copy of the text for convenience.  (The print version also has superior layout and typography.)  The UA bookstore should have loose-leaf copies at a discounted price, hole-punched for insertion into a three-ring binder.  Some of you may find that to be a convenient format.
</p>
<p>
  If you wish to seek a cheaper used copy, previous editions of the text should work just fine, though the further back you go, the more “drift” there will be in exercises, section numbers, and other details.  Still, most of the content is the same.  If you do obtain an earlier edition, check with me for information on some of the major differences.
