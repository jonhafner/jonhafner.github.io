<h2>Homework</h2>

<p>
  In this class, there are two types of “homework” in the broadest sense: <strong>Readings</strong> and <strong>Exercises</strong>.
</p>



<h3>Readings</h3>
<p>
  The text is packed with more information than it is possible to present in class, so you should read each section before and/or after the corresponding lecture.  A common recommendation is to give each section at least a light skim <em>before</em> it’s covered in class, so you have some idea what to expect and hopefully find the lecture more understandable.  Whether you do that or not, you should also read the section thoroughly and carefully <em>after</em> we cover it in class.  Make sure to check my posted notes on each section; some sections have no special remarks about the suggested readings, but many do.
</p>
<p>
  You should also read the text for the alternate presentation of some concepts and techniques.  Everyone has their own mathematical style; mine often agrees with Zill’s, but also often does not.  For any given topic, you may find my methods easier to use than Zill’s, but you may also find the reverse.  Either way, the more perspectives you can get on a topic, usually the better.
</p>



<h3 id="exercises">Exercises</h3>
<p>
  If you are anything like most students, you will need to work through a large number of exercises to gain proficiency with this material and become adequately prepared for the tests and the final exam.  In the <a href="syllabus-outline.pdf">syllabus outline</a>, I include a list of suggested exercises provided by another instructor.
</p>
<p>
  However, that doesn’t mean you should stop there!  If you have time, strongly consider doing more exercises than those; at the very least, you should <em>read</em> all the exercises in the sections we cover, as some of them contain some very interesting ideas.  Also, keep in mind that the tests and exam will be conducted under strict time limits.  One of your goals with the exercises should be to acquire the skills to solve problems, first as reliably as possible, then as quickly as possible without sacrificing accuracy.  Toward that end, many of you may find it necessary to practice more exercises than just those suggested.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, always feel free to ask me questions if anything has you confused or concerned, or if you’re just unsure or curious about something!  One of your goals should be to obtain mastery of the material, and one of my goals is to help you achieve that.
</p>
<p>
  As you work on these exercises, I recommend that you neatly write out solutions in full, as if you were going to submit them for grading.  This is both to serve as a record for your own reference and to help you practice clear, correct mathematical writing.  Or if that is insufficient motivation, keep in mind that if you ask me for assistance on a problem that’s giving you trouble, I may need to see your work to figure out where you went wrong, but that won’t help if I can’t read it!
