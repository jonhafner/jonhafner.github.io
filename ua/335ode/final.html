<h1>ODE</h1>

<h2>Final Exam</h2>

<p>
  <b>Schedule:</b>
  The final exam will be held on Tuesday, May 6, from 7:45–9:45 a.m. in ASEC 122.  Notify me immediately if you have any irreconcilable conflicts so we can arrange an alternative time for you.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Laplace table:</b>
  The last page of your exam will consist of <a href="exam-laplace.pdf">this table of Laplace transforms</a>.  The arrangement is a bit different from the one used on our Test 5, and many of the more complicated forms are omitted, but all the relevant entries are there.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Reference sheet:</b>
  You are permitted to bring a reference sheet to the exam, on which you may write whatever you wish.  It must fit on a <em>single side</em> of one sheet of standard US letter paper (8½″ × 11″).  You may wish to include not only formulae, but also names and procedures of major methods, forms of different types of equations, etc.  You will sometimes be instructed to apply a particular method, but most equations you are asked to solve will not provide any hints as to the expected technique!
</p>

<p>
  <b>Calculator:</b>
  You are permitted to use a calculator of a type approved for this course, but none will be necessary if you are comfortable with basic arithmetic.  (I didn’t have a calculator on hand when I took the exam to test its length, and I didn’t feel lacking.)
