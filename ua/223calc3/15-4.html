<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 15.4: Applications of Double Integrals</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  In this course, we focus only on the subsections “Density and Mass” and “Moments and Centers of Mass”.  (For some useful background on the latter, see § 8.3.)  The other sections are optional: they are useful and important applications, but we do not emphasize them in this course.  I’ve never seen them appear on a final exam, and I never test them myself.  However, they are useful and interesting, so I encourage you to at least skim these subsections and their corresponding exercises.  If any seem applicable to your studies or interests, give them a try.
