<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 15.2: Double Integrals over General Regions</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.  Don’t worry about memorizing the various technical formulae.  In particular, you won’t be asked to classify a region as “type I” or “type II”—you’ll just need to know how to recognize which way you should set up an integral.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–14, 17–40, 47–50, 55–66
</p>
<p>
  Recall that (to the best of my knowledge) you won’t be graded on 3D sketches, so #47–50 are just for the purposes of developing valuable skills.  Don’t worry if the results aren’t pretty—their value is solely for helping you visualize situations.
</p>
<p>
  If you want additional practice with some longer and more complex problems, #43–46 would be useful additions.
