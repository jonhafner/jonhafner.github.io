<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 14.6: Directional Derivatives and the Gradient Vector</h2>
<p>
  This section is packed with important information; read it carefully.  I’m not sure the sequence of the material is the clearest, however, so there are a couple points where slight detours might be useful:
</p>
<p>
  First, if you have trouble understanding what the directional derivative means—i.e., if you start to get lost somewhere around Definition 2, give or take—maybe briefly skip ahead to the subsection “Functions of Three Variables” and read the first few paragraphs, including Definition 10 and Equations 11 and 12.  I personally find Equation 11 in particular to be the clearest expression of what a directional derivative is; it’s the most compact, and its use of vector notation makes it work in any number of dimensions.  See if that helps give you some needed context.  Either way, with that in mind, then return to the beginning of the section to reread and continue from there.
</p>
<p>
  In the first couple examples, do your best to follow along, but don’t get too caught up in trying to learn the method just yet.  It becomes much easier to organize and conceptualize calculations of directional derivatives once we have gradient vectors, introduced in the second subsection.

  I work through a few examples myself in the following:

  Departmental suggestions: #4–35, 38–41, 47–52

<p>
  You will not be responsible for the content of #43, but I recommend reading it and thinking about what it says.  You will sometimes hear me refer to the gradient of a function as “a kind of derivative”; the properties shown here are one of the reasons why.  I hasten to clarify that this is highly informal language: the gradient is not, in any strict sense, “the derivative” of the function.  It does, however, provide similar information and play a similar role to that of the ordinary derivative of a function of a single variable.
