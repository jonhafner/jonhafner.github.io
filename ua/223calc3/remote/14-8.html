<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 14.8: Lagrange Multipliers</h2>
<p>
  In the previous section, we saw that some optimization problems had a special complication.  One type of these is an objective function with more than two variables, together with a constraint equation that can (hopefully) be solved for one variable in terms of the others to reduce the number of free variables.  Another issue arose in the context of finding absolute extrema on a bounded region when the boundary was curved instead of polygonal.  Handling these situations can be unpleasant even in simple situations, and can easily become intractable.
</p>
<p>
  Lagrange’s method is often an extremely useful tool for dealing with both of those, and more.  (As you study this material, you might return to some of those constraint problems from last section and try them again with this method for comparison.)  Our text thoroughly explains a geometric motivation and rigorous justification for this method of optimization, and even summarizes the method fairly nicely, though I might collect the two- and three-variable cases together and say that we wish to solve the system ∇<i>f</i>(<b>x</b>) = <i>λ</i>∇<i>g</i>(<b>x</b>), <i>g</i>(<b>x</b>) = <i>k</i>.
</p>
<p>
  As the textbook remarks, “the explicit values of <i>λ</i> are not needed for the conclusion of the method”.  It’s easy to miss the significance of this, so I’ll clarify:  It often happens that the easiest way to find the variables we care about involves solving for values of <i>λ</i>.  However, sometimes we are able to easily eliminate <i>λ</i> from consideration by some means; if that happens, there’s no reason to go back and solve for it!  We don’t actually need its value for any purpose except insofar as it helps us find the points of interest.

  I have little else to add other than working through a couple examples to illustrate some of the algebraic techniques and other considerations that may be useful:

</ul>
<p>
  As is often the case, the few examples I can show you do not at all cover every possible technique you may need.  To again quote the textbook, “There are no general rules for solving systems of equations.  Sometimes some ingenuity is required.”  Many students find this section to be a demanding test of their algebra skills!  All I can recommend is to study as many examples as you can, and be very careful when solving your systems.

  We don’t usually emphasize problems with two constraints in this course, but if you’d like to practice some of those anyway, see #30–33.
