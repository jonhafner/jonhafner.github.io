<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 12.1: Three-Dimensional Coördinate Systems</h2>

<p>
  First, read the introductory paragraph (in the eBook, this is <em>below</em> the first video), as it introduces some fundamental terminology and notation.  The video on this page seems to just restate things written in the upcoming subsection of the text; watch it or not, as you prefer.
</p>

<h3>3D Space</h3>
<p>
  Read this subsection, then watch my video, “§ 12.1a: Plotting points”
  (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwokrhWdeYE">Youtube</a> |

</p>

<h3>Surfaces and Solids</h3>
<p>
  Read this subsection.  The opening paragraph touches on a point that is much more significant than it might seem at first, which I’ll state in a moment.  If the following gets too abstract to follow, you can just focus on the examples in the text and then move on to the next subsection, but if this does make sense to you, I think it will be enlightening.
</p>
<p>
  The broader point is this:  In general, the solution set of an equation in <i>n</i> real variables is usually an (<i>n</i> – 1)-dimensional object, which divides the space ℝ<sup><i>n</i></sup> into two or more distinct regions.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if <i>n</i> = 1, we have a single real variable—say, <i>x</i>—in the one-dimensional space ℝ, the real line.  Think of any ordinary, algebraic equation in <i>x</i>; if it has any solutions, these will usually be isolated points.  (For example, a linear equation, such as 2<i>x</i> + 3 = 7, will have a single solution.)  Each such point is a zero-dimensional object, and when we plot it on the real line, it splits ℝ into two intervals, one to the left and one to the right.
</p>
<p>
  If <i>n</i> = 2, we have a pair of real variables—say, (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)—representing a location in the two-dimensional space ℝ<sup>2</sup>, the Euclidean real plane.
  Consider some common equations in <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>; a few simple examples include 2<i>x</i> + 5<i>y</i> = 10, <i>x</i> = <i>y</i><sup>2</sup>, <i>y</i> = sin <i>x</i>, or <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> = 9.
  The graphs of their solution sets will often be lines or curves.  Though they might be bent to occupy a two-dimensional space, these are in some sense one-dimensional objects, since you can locate any point on the curve by specifying a directed distance from a given reference point.  (Think about the arc length function from Calc II.)  Furthermore, many such graphs divide the plane into two regions—a top and a bottom, or a left and a right, or an inside and an outside.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, as the text casually remarks in passing, an equation in <em>three</em> variables will often have a solution set of (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>) triples forming a two-dimensional surface that divides the three-dimensional space ℝ<sup>3</sup> into two or more regions.
</p>
<p>
  This pattern continues into higher-dimensional spaces, though such geometries can be rather challenging to visualize!
</p>
<p>
  (Note my use of words like “many” and “often”.  The statements above are common with simple examples, but there are plenty of exceptions.  For example, in the <i>n</i> = 2 setting, a hyperbola cuts the plane into <em>three</em> regions, the tangent function cuts it into <em>infinitely many</em> regions, and the floor function, a.k.a. the greatest integer function, doesn’t divide the plane into separate pieces at all!  But note that even these are built out of curves, line segments, etc.; the general idea still holds, that graphs of equations tend to drop down one dimension from the containing space.)

<h3>Distance and Spheres</h3>
<p>
  Personally, I would recommend that <em>before</em> you read this subsection, you take a look at my video “§ 12.1b: Distance”
  (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCh64nYDCRY">Youtube</a> |
  <a href="https://uakron.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c0158906-3a86-4701-b638-ac1e002efab9">Panopto</a>) for a more conceptual approach to this topic that’s less notationally dense.  Then come back and resume reading the text.
</p>
<p>
  At some point during the discussion of spheres, you may wish to watch my video “§ 12.1c: Spheres”
  (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOw3KemUFRM">Youtube</a> |
  <a href="https://uakron.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=fa10bf3c-dbca-4a19-9d75-ac1e002eebc8">Panopto</a>).  The best time for this is probably between Examples 6 and 7, though you can try it earlier if you start getting lost during the stuff with spheres.  Even if spheres are making sense to you, I show a slightly more advanced example of completing the square that you may find valuable.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, read and think about Example 7 carefully.  This combines a couple different kinds of equations, modified to form inequalities, to describe regions in space in terms of their bounding surfaces.
</p>

<h3>A note on graphing:</h3>
<p>
  If you’re having difficulty drawing three-dimensional graphs, you might consider printing or purchasing some <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=isometric%20graph%20paper">isometric graph paper</a>.  I won’t ask you to submit any three-dimensional graphs to be graded, but you might find this useful for your own purposes.
