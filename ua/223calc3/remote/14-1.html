<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 14.1: Functions of Several Variables</h2>

<p>
  Read this section carefully.  The examples in the text are quite thorough, and the illustrations are often superior to what I can produce by hand.  (If you aren’t interested in economics and/or find the examples dealing with the Cobb-Douglas function to be difficult to understand, feel free to skim or skip those.)
</p>
<p>
  If you have a solid understanding of functions of a single variable, including their domains and ranges, you should find most of this material to be a natural extension of those concepts.  If you struggle a bit with those ideas, however, you may need to take more care.  In particular, if you’re in the habit of thinking, “domain is <i>x</i>-values, range is <i>y</i>-values,” you will need to refine your understanding, as that no longer holds.  (It doesn’t even hold for functions of a single variable, as when a position <i>x</i> is a function of time <i>t</i>, for instance.)
</p>
<p>
  If you would like to see me work through an analysis of a function, I do so in “§ 14.1: A function of two variables” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMhv_-__gm8">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://uakron.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=18049b67-a1f9-4404-aeb5-ac5400d17919">Panopto</a>).

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–16, 19–31, 35–38, 41–52, 55–56, 61–66

<p>
  (I believe we have mostly skipped the exercises explicitly addressing biology or economics, but if you have any interest in those, I encourage you to try them.)
