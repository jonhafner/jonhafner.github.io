<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 13.2: Derivatives and Integrals of Vector Functions</h2>

<p>
  Thanks to Theorem 2, we can take derivatives and integrals of vector functions componentwise, so most things here should not be too surprising.  Just a few items of note:
</p>

<h3>Derivatives</h3>
<p>
  Do your best to convince yourself of <em>why</em> the derivative of a vector function produces its tangent vectors.  It might help if we preview an idea from § 13.4:  Imagine a particle moving along a path in space.  If <b>r</b>(<i>t</i>) is the position of a particle at time <i>t</i>, then <b>r</b>′(<i>t</i>) is its velocity!  At time <i>t</i>, <b>r</b>′(<i>t</i>) points in the direction of movement, and its magnitude is the speed.
</p>
<p>
  Also make sure you recognize that the unit tangent vector is simply the tangent vector divided by its own magnitude to scale it to unit length.  It’s exactly what the name says.  The definition given in the text is not a special thing to be memorized, just the symbolic expression of that idea.
</p>
<p>
  In “§ 13.2a: Tangent vector” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz-5nHHS_Ds">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://uakron.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c01de2f0-e34c-439a-9e7d-ac4601413f2f">Panopto</a>), I illustrate some of these ideas in a two-dimensional setting.
</p>
<h3>Differentiation Rules</h3>
<p>
  Theorem 3 states vector equivalents of several of the basic derivative rules you know from Calculus I.  Properties 1 and 2 together tell us that differentiation of vector functions is a linear operator, just like summations, limits, and the differentiation and integration of real-valued functions.  Properties 3–5 are product rules, one for each form of multiplication we have with vectors.  And as noted, Property 6 is a chain rule.
</p>
<p>
  Pay close attention to Theorem 4, its proof, and the commentary and figure following it.  Think about it in both the three-dimensional setting described and the two-dimensional equivalent.  (Note that the theorem and its proof do not appeal to components or depend on a particular number of dimensions.)  This fact is of considerable geometric significance, and we’ll see some applications of it later.
</p>

<h3>Integrals</h3>
<p>
  These can also be handled componentwise, so in principle, they should be just as easy as derivatives.  Some students find them a little tricky, though, so I worked through a couple examples,

  and
