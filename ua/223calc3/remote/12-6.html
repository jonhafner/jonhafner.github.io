<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 12.6: Cylinders and Quadric Surfaces</h2>

<h3>Cylinders</h3>
<p>
  I feel the text explains this topic clearly; I have little to add.  The examples and video in the eBook describe most of the key factors, but the links to the animations are probably the most valuable portion of this subsection!  Those animations illustrate the examples with movements that even the video lacks, and that really help convey the idea of what’s happening, I think.
</p>

<h3>Quadric Surfaces</h3>
<p>
  (Also sometimes called “quadratic surfaces”.)  This topic is also explained quite thoroughly by the text.  In particular, the figures and animations are superior to anything I would be able to create!  And this is to say nothing of the two “Explore It” interactive tools, which I strongly urge you to play around with to help develop some intuition for how these objects behave.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, we may feel far more limited when trying to sketch the graph of such a thing by hand, so I’ll show you a quick example of how I would tackle one of these problems in my video “§ 12.6: Graphing a quadric surface” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8we6M2dH4Q">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://uakron.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=38545812-ef1c-433c-a36c-ac3e00e1a414">Panopto</a>).  Don’t expect it to look very nice—and again, I won’t ask you to draw any 3D graphs to be graded.  But it is very useful to learn how to sketch these things for yourself to help wrap your head around an object or situation described in a problem.
</p>
<p>
  Table 1 provides a useful summary of the six main types of quadric surfaces.  (Be sure to click the “+” button to view the entire table.)  Note that the equations given are examples of the standard forms, but when there’s an asymmetry, you can swap variables around to change the axis along which the figure is oriented.  You should try to become as familiar as you can with these surfaces, as we will see them throughout this course, but I do not recommend brute-force memorizing the entirety of Table 1.  The necessary level of familiarity should come through practice, especially if you observe a few useful patterns and relationships:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Start with the ellipsoid.  Observe that the equation looks just like that of an ellipse except for the inclusion of a <i>z</i> term.  Just as <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> still tell you the lengths of the semiaxes in the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> directions respectively, <i>c</i> now gives the distance in the <i>z</i> direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall that in the plane, if you negate one of the terms in an ellipse, you obtain a hyperbola.  The situation is similar here, and conveniently, if there is only one negative term, the graph is a hyperboloid of one sheet, while if there are two negative terms, you have a hyperboloid of two sheets.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now compare the paraboloids.  Note that these are distinguised by having one variable to only the first power, in much the same way that parabolas are distinct from the other conic sections.  If you isolate that variable on one side of the equation, then the form of the other side will tell you whether the paraboloid is elliptic or hyperbolic in the obvious way—i.e., whether the terms have the same sign, like an ellipse, or opposite signs, like a hyperbola.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If those observations make sense to you, that basically covers five of the six standard forms!  Also remember that when in doubt, you can check some traces.
</p>

<h3>Applications of Quadric Surfaces</h3>
<p>
  This short little subsection is definitely worth a read.  Just like conic sections, quadric surfaces have a great many practical uses, particularly for their structural and geometric properties.  The text only touches on a few—if you’re interested, I suggest doing some research online for more.  However, if vague memories of foci and reflection properties from Precalc are causing you concern, don’t worry: you will not be expected to learn the 3D equivalents of such things for this class.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–40
</p>
<p>
  Again, we will not ask you to sketch three-dimensional graphs for grading, but most of you will find these skills to be <em>very</em> useful later in the course, especially in Chapter 15.  (Sketching graphs is not usually strictly necessary, but being able to visualize the solid regions described can make many of those problems much easier.)  Toward that end, consider also working exercises #41–50 and 54–55 if you have the time and resources.  I also suggest you at least read #51–53, and perhaps work them out if you find them interesting.
