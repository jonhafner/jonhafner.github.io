<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 12.2: Vectors</h2>

<p>
  In this context, we commonly define a <strong>vector</strong> as a quantity having both magnitude and direction.  Aside from a single exception (the zero vector has no well-defined direction), this works well enough for our purposes.
</p>
<p>
  The early portions of this section give some physical examples of vectors, such as displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force; momentum is another common example from physics.  In their strict technical senses, all of these quantities specify not only magnitudes, but also directions.
</p>
<p>
  Some of those quantities have special names for their magnitudes: the magnitude of a displacement is a distance, and the magnitude of a velocity is a speed.  Distance and speed are simple real numbers, with no sense of direction; these are called <strong>scalars</strong>.  Other common examples of scalars include length, area, volume, time, mass, energy, temperature … probably the majority of “normal” quantities, numbers, or variables you are accustomed to dealing with are scalars.
</p>

  At this point, if you have not yet, read the introduction and the first subsection, which is…

<h3>Geometric Description of Vectors</h3>
<p>
  Read this subsection carefully.  Note the importance of distinguishing between vectors and scalars in print and writing!  It is difficult to write in “bold print” by hand, so additional marks are commonly used.  For example, the vector <b>v</b> is perhaps most commonly written with a small arrow ( <i>v&#x20D7;</i> ) or half-arrow ( <i>v&#x20D1;</i> ) above.  Some writers place these symbols below the variable instead, or place a bar or tilde above or below, though these are much less common.  Whichever notation you choose, be sure to write it clearly and consistently!
</p>
<p>
  The two most common geometric interpretations of vector addition are given by the Triangle Law and the Parallelogram Law, as illustrated in Figures 3 and 4.  You will probably come to favor one over the other, but sometimes one is more natural than the other in a particular situation, so make sure you understand and can use both.
</p>

<h3>Components of a Vector</h3>
<p>
  I personally feel like the sequence of topics in this subsection is a little bit backwards and the motivations are unclear.  The text works okay as written, but if you find yourself getting confused, try my video “§ 12.2a: Unit vectors and components” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I8p__rhuRg">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://uakron.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=4ed0f17b-d670-453a-a2dd-ac2b00fe3da9">Panopto</a>), in which I present the key points in a different order and with different explanations.  I also try to clarify some notation and underlying concepts.  Afterward, you’ll want to return to read the rest of this subsection.
</p>
<p>
  In words instead of symbols, the Properties of Vectors in the box midway through this subsection tell us that vector addition and scalar multiplication are associative, commutative, and distributive, <b>0</b> is the additive identity, and 1 is the multiplicative identity.  This is analogous to the algebra of real numbers.
</p>

<h3>Applications</h3>
<p>
  Read this subsection in full.  If you’d like to see me work through an additional example, watch “§ 12.2b: Application (#34)” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGgpZd7Zs9Q">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://uakron.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=0631bc1c-b5bc-4bdf-b9c5-ac2b0130fd7c">Panopto</a>).

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–33
</p>
<p>
  I would suggest that you also work #41 and #43, and take a look at #52.
