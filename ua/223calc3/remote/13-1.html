<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 13.1: Vector Functions and Space Curves</h2>

<p>
  Read this section in full.  A few comments:
</p>

<h3>Vector-Valued Functions</h3>
<p>
  First, a technicality:  When the text defines a <strong>vector-valued function</strong>, or <strong>vector function</strong>, it says that it is “a function whose domain is a set of real numbers and whose range is a set of vectors.”  It’s actually just the range being a set of vectors that makes the function vector-valued.  (It’s right there in the name: a function whose values are vectors.)  True, in this chapter, we’ll only deal with vector functions whose domains are sets of real numbers, but this does not have to be the case.  For example, in Chapter 16 we’ll see vector-valued functions whose domains are subsets of ℝ² or ℝ³.
</p>
<p>
  These functions are not as new as the textbook makes them sound.  If you understood the parametric and vector equations of lines in § 12.5, these are the same thing, except that the component functions can be nonlinear.  (You might also recall parametric equations in two dimensions from Calculus II; see § 10.1.)  In this chapter, we’ll be exploring more things we can do with such objects, mostly (but not exclusively) in a three-dimensional setting.
</p>

<h3>Limits and Continuity</h3>
<p>
  While an ε-δ definition is better for theoretical purposes, the componentwise definition given here is much more convenient for application.  If you are rusty on limits, review Chapter 2, as well as the trigonometric limits in § 3.3 and l’Hospital’s Rule in § 4.4.
</p>

<h3>Space Curves</h3>
<p>
  Except for the simplest cases, curves in space tend to be difficult to visualize and draw.  Pay extra attention to the animations and “Explore It” interactive widgets in the eBook.  If you have access to appropriate software, you might try using that to check your work, and to experiment with further explorations of your own.  As always, though, these are aids for your own visualization and understanding—I will not ask you to create and submit such drawings to be graded!
</p>
<p>
  When you do attempt to draw these curves by hand, or at least get a mental handle on approximately what they look like, there are several techniques that are often useful, besides just sequentially plotting sample points.  One of these is to begin by drawing the curve’s projections onto the three coördinate planes; this is explored in Exercises #19–20.  It can also be helpful if you can recognize that the curve lies within a simple surface, or at the intersection of two or three such surfaces; for this, see Exercises #31–38.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–30, 35–36, 39–40, 50–54
</p>
<p>
  As noted above, if you want more practice working with surfaces containing curves, see all of #31–38, not just the #35–36 suggested.
</p>
<p>
  Whether you work through them or not, make sure you understand #57–58, as the distinction between intersection and collision is sometimes very important.
