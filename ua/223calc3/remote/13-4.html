<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 13.4: Motion in Space: Velocity and Acceleration</h2>

<h3>Velocity, Speed, and Acceleration</h3>
<p>
  Read this subsection carefully.  I mentioned in the notes for § 13.2 that the tangent vector can be thought of as velocity; this idea that the first derivative is velocity and the second is acceleration is a natural extension of what you did in Calculus I.  I work through an example in “§ 13.4a: Velocity, acceleration, and speed (Exercise #12)” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps5gIK75hIw">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://uakron.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=6c568610-4986-4b7d-91a7-ac5200f8c7a0">Panopto</a>).
</p>

<h3>Projectile Motion</h3>
<p>
  This subsection illustrates some common applications of the ideas from the previous.  Example 6 makes use of equations derived in Example 5, but those are probably not worth memorizing unless you’re in a field that uses them extensively.  I work through a similar example <em>without</em> such equations, just using vector calculus, in “§ 13.4b: Projectile motion (Exercise #32)” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTqCdDOruxw">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://uakron.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=801d3495-91e5-45fe-84f2-ac5200f84ac4">Panopto</a>).
</p>

<h3>Tangential and Normal Components of Acceleration</h3>
<p>
  This decomposition of acceleration is an important idea, but not a major topic.  Read this subsection carefully, but don’t worry about memorizing these formulae; feel free to reference them to answer the exercises about them.  I don’t recall ever seeing this topic appear on a final exam.
</p>
<p>
  The example of a passenger in a car is a good way to understand the normal component of acceleration.  Continuing with that, the tangential component is parallel to the direction of travel; this translates to the forward or backward force you feel when the driver presses the gas or brake pedals.

<h3>Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion</h3>
<p>
  This subsection is entirely optional, but if you have any interest in astronomy or astrophysics, I highly recommend you read it, along with the Applied Project following the section.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #3–21, 23, 25, 37–42
</p>
<p>
  As usual, also read the other exercises, and try any you find interesting.  For example, #29 is about medieval siege warfare, and #46 is about basic rocket science!
