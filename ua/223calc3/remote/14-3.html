<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 14.3: Partial Derivatives</h2>
<!-- I used to have an exception for the Cobb-Douglas production function, but that has been moved to a post-section Discovery Project! -->
<p>
  Read this section fully and carefully.
</p>
<p>
  Note that we cannot use the prime notation (e.g., <i>f′</i>) to denote a derivative of a function of more than one independent variable, since that gives no indication of <em>which</em> variable we are differentiating with respect to.  The closest analogue of the prime notation is the use of subscripts, such as <i>f<sub>x</sub></i>, <i>f<sub>y</sub></i>, etc.
</p>
<p>
  When using the Leibniz notation, be very careful to distinguish the curly, stylized d-like symbol “∂” from the “<i>d</i>” used for ordinary derivatives.  For instance, you will later see a situation in which <i>dz</i>/<i>dt</i> and ∂<i>z</i>/∂<i>t</i> mean very different things!  Be very careful to clearly distinguish between partial and ordinary derivatives in your notation, even when you don’t see why it makes a difference.

  The final subsection discusses Partial Differential Equations.  I should point out that we may ask you to check or confirm a possible solution to a PDE, but we will <em>not</em> ask you to obtain such a solution on your own.  That is the subject of much more advanced classes.  So for now, don’t worry about where such solutions come from—simply observe how we work with them.

  Also, I recommend you read through #80–92 to get a sense for some of the applications of these ideas and techniques, and try any you find interesting.
