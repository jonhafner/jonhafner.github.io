<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 14.2: Limits and Continuity</h2>
<p>
  This section vacillates between relatively straightforward topics and significantly more challenging concepts.  Where a function definition is clearly continuous, matters of limits and continuity are natural extensions of the fundamental concepts from Calculus I.  However, when we have possible discontinuities (such as a point where the definition would give division by zero), things become much more complicated.
</p>
<p>
  If we suspect that a limit does not exist at a particular point, the methods illustrated in Examples 1–3 show how we can demonstrate the presence of such an essential singularity.  The core idea is analogous to a concept from Calculus I: for a function of a single variable, consider the left-hand and right-hand limits, and if the one-sided limits do not agree, the two-sided limit does not exist.  The problem is that with two or more independent variables, we now have infinitely many paths of approach, so it’s not so straightforward.  A standard approach in such situations is to begin by considering some simple paths of approach, such as by holding <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> each constant in turn, as demonstrated in Example 1.  If those differ, you are done.  If they match, you may have to try additional paths, as illustrated in Examples 2 and 3.  In the exercises we give you in this course, most limits that do not exist can be shown to be so using relatively simple paths, so don’t get too creative here!
</p>
<p>
  In situations where limit laws and basic continuity arguments do not apply, proving that a limit <em>does</em> exist can be much more challenging, as demonstrated by Example 6.  Formal ε–δ proofs of limits are beyond what we expect of you in this class, so if you have difficulty understanding the details of Example 6, Solution 1, don’t fret too much; just try to follow as much as you can.  Solution 2 should be easier to comprehend.  (If you discover that any of the suggested exercises require techniques more advanced than the Squeeze Theorem, let me know!)
</p>
<p>
  For the rest of this course, we will almost always deal with functions that are continuous everywhere that matters.  This is very limited, but enough to get started with, and sufficient for many practical purposes.  Be mindful of these concerns in general, however, and remain alert for possible discontinuities in the functions you encounter in the future.
