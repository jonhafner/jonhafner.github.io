<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 15.2: Double Integrals over General Regions</h2>
<p>
  Read this section in full, but you don’t have to memorize the various technical formulae.  In particular, you won’t be asked to classify a region as “type I” or “type II”—you’ll just need to know how to recognize which way you should set up an integral.  You may find that the skills you developed in Calculus II for setting up integrals to calculate areas between curves and volumes of solids of revolution (disks, washers, shells) may be adapted somewhat to this new setting.
</p>
<p>
  When setting up iterated integrals over non-rectangular regions, there is an important principle to keep in mind:  <strong>The bounds on the outermost integral must be constants</strong> (at least with respect to the variables of integration).  The bounds on an inner integral may depend on the variables of integrals surrounding it.  No integral should have bounds depending on its own variable or the variables of any integrals inside of it.  This is why changing the order of integration is not as trivial as just switching the integrals; Example 5 is a very simple illustration of the method.

  There’s a bit of technique to setting up double integrals over non-rectangular regions, so I work through some examples here, including evaluation:

  <li><p>§ 15.2b: Exercise #40 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myB91736-pc">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://uakron.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=5d741cd9-0f1a-47f7-bbb7-ac7000f11fa8">Panopto</a>)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–14, 17–40, 47–50, 55–66
</p>
<p>
  Recall that (to the best of my knowledge) you won’t be graded on 3D sketches, so #47–50 are just for the purposes of developing valuable skills.  Don’t worry if the results aren’t pretty—their value is solely for helping you visualize situations.
</p>
<p>
  If you want additional practice with some longer and more complex problems, #43–46 would be useful additions.
