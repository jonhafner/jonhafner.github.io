<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 16.5: Curl and Divergence</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section, though you won’t be responsible for the subsection “Vector Forms of Green’s Theorem”; for our purposes, that’s just useful context.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–12, 15–24
</p>
<p>
  I strongly urge you to also work through #14 very carefully, as it is a good test and exploration of some very important skills and concepts.
</p>
<p>
  Exercise #40 presents forms of Maxwell’s equations for electromagnetism for a common special case.  If this is related to your studies (e.g., physics, electrical engineering), you might find it interesting to pursue this further.
