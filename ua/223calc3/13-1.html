<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 13.1: Vector Functions and Space Curves</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.  You won’t be required to use technology to draw space curves in this class, but that part contains useful information nonetheless.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–30, 35–36, 39–40, 50–54
</p>
<p>
  If you want more practice working with surfaces containing curves, see all of #31–38, not just the #35–36 suggested.
</p>
<p>
  Whether you work through them or not, make sure you understand #57–58, as the distinction between intersection and collision is sometimes very important.
