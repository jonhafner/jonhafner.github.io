<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 15.3: Double Integrals in Polar Coördinates</h2>
<p>
  If you’re rusty on polar, perhaps briefly review § 10.3.  If you are comfortable working with polar coördinates, and are also comfortable with double integrals from the past couple sections, this section is mostly just a natural combination of those.
</p>
<p>
  The least obvious part, and the bit most likely to trip students up, is the need to include the scaling factor <i>r</i> when setting up or converting integrals into polar.  This is a consequence of how area is calculated in the polar space.  We often think of that factor as part of the expression for the differential area, saying that <i>dA</i> = <i>dx dy</i> = <i>r dr dθ</i>.  See Figure 5 and the paragraph preceding it.
</p>
<p>
  (There’s an absolutely terrible joke that I only continue to share because some students report that it helps them remember that form: “What’s a pirate’s favorite way to integrate?  With polar coördinates: ARR, dee-arr, dee-theta.”  …  I’m sorry.  But I hope the thought of “pirate integration” helps some of you more than it hurts the rest!)

  The video at the beginning of this section in the eBook includes some examples; if you’d like to see more, I’ve recorded a few:

<h3>Exercises</h3>

  Departmental suggestions: #1–42

  Exercise #38 is an interesting result.  After you have worked through it yourself, if you’d like more information about this possibly surprising situation, I recommend you search online for the “napkin ring problem”; if you want, you might start with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napkin_ring_problem">the Wikipedia article</a> on the topic.
</p>
<p>
  Also of note: The “bell curve” of the normal distribution is an important object of study in probability and statistics.  It is a transformation of exp(−<i>x</i>²), but that function has no elementary antiderivative, complicating the computation of the area under the curve (which is necessary for probability calculations).  Astonishingly, however, we are able to calculate its integral over all of ℝ, obtaining what might be a surprising result.  The method is quite clever and is outlined in Exercise #50; I recommend you at least read through the exercise and see if you can get the gist.  We don’t expect you to do things that challenging in this course, but if you have the time and inclination, give it a try for yourself!
