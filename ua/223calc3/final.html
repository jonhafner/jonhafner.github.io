<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>Final Exam</h2>

<h3>Schedule</h3>
<p>
  The final exam will be held on Wednesday, December 7, from 5:15–7:15 p.m. (17:15–19:15) in our usual classroom.  Notify me immediately if you have any irreconcilable conflicts so we can arrange an alternative time for you.
</p>

<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>
  If you’ve been diligently working a large number of suggested exercises throughout the semester, you should be mostly prepared for the exam.  Still, a review may be helpful, so here are some practice materials for you to do with as you will, supplied by the Department:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="Calc3FinalSampleProblems.pdf">Sample Problems</a></li>
  <li><a href="final1.pdf">2015 Fall exam</a></li>
  <li><a href="final2.pdf">2016 Summer exam</a></li>
  <li><a href="final3.pdf">2016 Fall exam</a></li>
  <li><a href="final4.pdf">2017 Spring exam</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
  I only have partial answer keys, and those I do have, I don’t think I can distribute.  However, you are welcome to send me your answers, and I’ll be happy to check them for you!  (As well as answer any other questions you may have, of course.)
</p>
<p>
  Obviously, as you find topics that give you difficulty, you should go back and review the notes and textbook from those sections, and also work more exercises (especially any you left undone on your first pass).  See also the Chapter Reviews in the textbook for more exercises you can practice.  You can also find some old exams (both final and midterm) posted by <a href="https://www.math.uakron.edu/~kreider/calc3/Calc3.html">Dr. Kreider</a> and <a href="https://www.math.uakron.edu/~norfolk/calc3.html">Dr. Norfolk</a>.
