<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>Final Exam</h2>

<h3>Schedule</h3>
<p>
  The final exam will be held on Tuesday, May&nbsp;4, from 7:45–9:45&nbsp;a.m.  Notify me immediately if you have any irreconcilable conflicts (e.g., work shifts or other exams) so we can arrange an alternative time for you.
</p>

<h3>Policies and Conduct</h3>
<p>
  The exam will of course be open-book and open-note, but <strong>all forms of collaboration are strictly prohibited.</strong>  You <strong>MAY NOT</strong> discuss the contents of the exam with any person via any medium.  All work must be solely your own.  We will be actively looking for signs of academic dishonesty.  Remember that sharing your work with someone is just as punishable as copying work from someone.
</p>

<h3>Format and Delivery</h3>
<p>
  The exam will be administered through Brightspace during the specified window of time.  Write up your work on paper, and when you are finished, scan or photograph your solutions and upload your file(s) to the designated page in Brightspace.
</p>
<p>
  A “practice assignment” is either currently available in Brightspace (look for an “Announcement”) or will be soon.  I urge you to watch the instructional video and try the assignment at your earliest convenience to make sure the process is working for you.  (The video is the same one from last semester, so minor details may differ, but the essential content is the same.)  Let me know if you encounter any difficulties.  This practice assignment is optional, but if you neglect to complete it and then encounter technical difficulties uploading your exam, I will be much less sympathetic to your plight.
</p>

<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>
  If you’ve been diligently working a large number of suggested exercises throughout the semester, you should be mostly prepared for the exam.  Still, a review may be helpful, so here are some practice materials for you to do with as you will, supplied by the Department:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="Calc3FinalSampleProblems.pdf">Sample Problems</a></li>
  <li><a href="final1.pdf">2015 Fall exam</a></li>
  <li><a href="final2.pdf">2016 Summer exam</a></li>
  <li><a href="final3.pdf">2016 Fall exam</a></li>
  <li><a href="final4.pdf">2017 Spring exam</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note that these materials are a few years old at this point; in particular, they have not been adapted to resemble the current online format.  They should still reflect the scope and content to a reasonable degree, aside from the fact that your exam is likely to be a bit shorter due to the additional administrative overhead this semester.
</p>
<p>
  I only have partial answer keys, and those I do have, I’m not sure I can distribute.  However, you are welcome to send me your answers, and I’ll be happy to check them for you!  (As well as answer any other questions you may have, of course.)
</p>
<p>
  Obviously, as you find topics that give you difficulty, you should go back and review those sections: my notes, the textbook, and the videos, and also work more exercises (especially any you left undone on your first pass).  See also the Chapter Reviews in the textbook for more exercises you can practice.  You can also find some old exams (both final and midterm) posted by <a href="http://math.uakron.edu/~kreider/calc3/Calc3.html">Dr. Kreider</a> and <a href="http://www.math.uakron.edu/~norfolk/calc3.html">Dr. Norfolk</a>.
