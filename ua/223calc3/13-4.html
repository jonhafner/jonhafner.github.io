<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 13.4: Motion in Space: Velocity and Acceleration</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  The core material is covered in the section opening and Projectile Motion.  The concepts of the Tangential and Normal Components of Acceleration are important, but you do not need to memorize the formulae for those.  Kepler’s Laws are strictly optional, but if you have any interest in astronomy or astrophysics, I very strongly recommend reading this part, as well as the Applied Project following the section.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #3–21, 23, 25, 37–42
</p>
<p>
  As usual, also read the other exercises, and try any you find interesting.  For example, #29 is about medieval siege warfare, and #46 is about basic rocket science!
