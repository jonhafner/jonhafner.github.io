<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 16.5*: Divergence and Curl</h2>

<p>This is the section I’ve altered the most, and the only one I’ve moved to a different position in the sequence.  The presentation of divergence and curl is the biggest point of disagreement I have with Stewart.  Because of this, I don’t recommend reading this section until <em>after</em> we’ve finished covering it in class.  Once that’s done, feel free to consult the textbook for additional information and examples.</p>

<p>Note that the last part of this section (just over a page), titled “Vector Forms of Green’s Theorem”, addresses material from § 16.4, which we have not covered yet.  Ignore that for now; I will cover this material in § 16.4*.</p>
