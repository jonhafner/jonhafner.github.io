<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 12.5: Equations of Lines and Planes</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.  You don’t need to pay much attention to the symmetric equations for lines (box 3) as these are rarely encountered in practice.  They may show up in some exercises, but we won’t ask you about them on exams.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Planes:</strong>
  Some of you might be interested in trying to get a bit more intuition for why the scalar equations of planes work the way they do.  We can build up to that by starting with linear equations in two dimensions and exploring their behavior.  (If this doesn’t interest you, feel free to skip it.)
</p>
<p>
  First, consider the analog in ℝ², a line of the form <i>ax</i> + <i>by</i> = 0.  Note that it passes through the origin, and be sure you understand why ⟨<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>⟩ is normal to it.  (Sketch the vector, and think about slopes.  Maybe solve the equation for <i>y</i> to make the slope more apparent.)  Observe how you can then shift it to pass through another fixed point by subtracting values from <i>x</i> and/or <i>y</i>.  Also think about the way putting a nonzero constant <i>c</i> on the right-hand side of the equation shifts the line around, particularly from the viewpoint of sliding it in the direction of the normal vector.  Play around with this for a while, with various examples.
</p>
<p>
  Once this is in your head, move back up to the analogous situation in ℝ³, starting with the plane <i>ax</i> + <i>by</i> + <i>cz</i> = 0, and making sure you understand why the coefficients are the components of the normal vector, and how altering them changes the “tilt” of the plane.  Again, explore how to shift that to other places—either by subtracting constants from the variables, or by putting a nonzero constant <i>d</i> on the RHS to slide the plane along its normal vector.
</p>

  That’s a rough sketch of the general idea.  If you try this for yourself, let me know how it goes!  This is something that’s a bit hard to explain, and I could use the feedback.

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–20, 23–26, 28–48, 50–58, 61–67, 71–74.  (Feel free to skip the symmetric equations in #6–12, and you might opt to find a different form of the line in #15(a).)
</p>

  There are many applications of the ideas presented in this section, and many types of questions that can be asked about them.  I’ll work through a handful of examples in class, but that’s still just plucking out a few special cases from a very long list of possibilities.  Even more than most topics, you’ll probably need to practice a large variety of exercises to develop the ability to tackle whatever random problems may be thrown your way.  Try to get as firm a grasp as you can on the geometric qualities of these objects, in addition to their algebraic descriptions.
