<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 15.8: Triple Integrals in Spherical Coördinates</h2>
<p>
  Cylindrical coördinates were basically just polar with a <i>z</i>-axis extended out of the plane; spherical coördinates are in some sense a more “thoroughly” polar system, more “native” to a three-dimensional space.  We still have a radius (designated here with <i>ρ</i>, the Greek letter rho, analogous to the Latin letter <i>r</i>), and <i>θ</i> works just as it does in polar and cylindrical, measuring a directed angle from the positive <i>x</i>-axis within the <i>xy</i>-plane.  What’s new is the angle <i>φ</i>, measured off of the positive <i>z</i>-axis.
</p>
<p>
  It might help to draw some analogies with how we indicate locations on Earth.  Imagine a perfectly spherical model globe, with its surface marked to imitate Earth.  Place the center of the globe at the origin of our coördinate system, with the north pole on the positive <i>z</i>-axis, the south pole on the negative <i>z</i>-axis, and the equator in the <i>xy</i>-plane.  The radius <i>ρ</i> is simply the radius of the globe—how far we are from the center.  By convention, we keep <i>ρ</i> ≥ 0.
</p>
<p>
  If you rotate the globe as needed so the prime meridian intersects the positive <i>x</i>-axis, then <i>θ</i> measures the longitude, with positive values to the east, negative to the west.  We try to keep the values of <i>θ</i> within the span of a single rotation, typically either 0 ≤ <i>θ</i> ≤ 2<i>π</i> or −<i>π</i> ≤ <i>θ</i> ≤ <i>π</i>.  The latter is analogous to our tendency to measure longitude between −180° and 180°.
</p>
<p>
  The angle <i>φ</i>, then, is <em>sort of</em> analogous to latitude, but not precisely.  Rather than measuring the angle above or below the equator, we’re instead measuring the angle away from the north pole: the north pole itself is at <i>φ</i> = 0, the equator (i.e., the <i>xy</i>-plane) is at <i>φ</i> = <i>π</i>/2, and the south pole is at <i>φ</i> = <i>π</i>.
  We confine this angle to the interval 0 ≤ <i>φ</i> ≤ <i>π</i>, only half the range of <i>θ</i>.  This is sufficient, because if you had a greater value of <i>φ</i>, you would have passed through the south pole and started creeping up the other side, in which case you would really be at a smaller value of <i>φ</i> (latitude) but with a different <i>θ</i> (longitude).
</p>
<p>
  With that perspective in mind, see the text and video in the eBook for the equations describing the coördinate transformations.  I show a few quick examples of dealing with this geometry in “§ 15.8a: Surfaces and solids in spherical” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feMUWTUgSmo">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://uakron.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=31410148-825e-4086-a508-ac7c00f636d2">Panopto</a>).
</p>
<p>
  When setting up an integral in spherical, we need to account for how volume is computed in this space.  Just as polar and cylindrical required the insertion of a factor of <i>r</i>, spherical requires a factor of <i>ρ</i>² sin <i>φ</i>.  I work through an example in “§ 15.8b: Integrating in spherical (Exercise #26)” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoTOYY2-n7c">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://uakron.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=6e33a471-be9b-4491-a0cb-ac7c00f598a8">Panopto</a>).

  And as always, don’t forget to consult the textbook examples!  Example 4 is particularly good, especially with its associated figures.  Note, however, that geometric insight can occasionally permit you to bypass certain cumbersome analysis.  For example, in Example 4, Stewart goes to some length to deduce that the given cone is described by  <i>φ</i> = <i>π</i>/4.  However, if you consider what the cone reduces to in, say, the <i>xz</i>- or <i>yz</i>-plane, you should be able to see pretty quickly that it has a “slope” of 1, and thus the angle between it and an axis is <i>π</i>/4!  (Alternatively, you can view it through the perspective of cylindrical coördinates and observe that <i>z</i> = <i>r</i>, leading to the same conclusion.)  Symbolic analysis basically always works, but generally speaking, the more geometric intuition you are able to develop, the better.

  <strong>Caution:</strong> While we maintain consistent notational conventions within this course and textbook, different sources and disciplines sometimes make different choices.  The use of <i>r</i> and <i>ρ</i> might be switched, for instance, or only one of these might be used in all cases.  Worse, <i>θ</i> and <i>φ</i> may be switched in position, meaning, or both!  Always be careful to check the local conventions in any new context.
