<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 12.2: Vectors — remote day</h2>

<h3>Components of a Vector</h3>
<p>
  Assuming you were in class on Friday, you should be ready to start the subsection in the textbook called “Components of a Vector”.  You can certainly pick up there and read the rest of that section in the textbook; it’s fine.  However, I personally feel like the sequence of topics in this subsection is a little bit backwards and the motivations are unclear.  For that reason, I pivoted some of the unit vector discussion forward; this is what I covered at the end of Friday’s class.  If you’d like to pick up that thread, see my video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I8p__rhuRg">§ 12.2a: Unit vectors and components</a>.  If you don’t need a recap, you can skip ahead to 23:00 to drop in where I left off at the end of class.  (It’s a bit long, so feel free to pause and take breaks as desired.)

<blockquote>
  <strong>A correction:</strong> Near the end of the video, when I used travel on Earth as an example, four-years-ago me made a blunder when speaking off the cuff.  For it to work correctly, the distance traveled needs to take us down to the equator; otherwise, the travel east would not be a geodesic (a locally “straight” path).  Just expand the lengths correspondingly, and the basic idea holds.
</blockquote>
<p>
  Afterward, you’ll still want to read the rest of this subsection in the textbook.

<p>
  In words instead of symbols, the Properties of Vectors in the box midway through this subsection tell us that vector addition and scalar multiplication are associative, commutative, and distributive, <b>0</b> is the additive identity, and 1 is the multiplicative identity.  This is analogous to the algebra of real numbers.
</p>

<h3>Applications</h3>
<p>
  Read this subsection in full.  If you’d like to see me work through an additional example, watch  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGgpZd7Zs9Q">§ 12.2b: Application (#34)</a>.
