<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 12.4: The Cross Product</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.  I do not recommend trying to memorize Definition 4; an easier method of computing cross products is explained immediately following, with two examples.  Another, <a href="algebraic-cross-product.pdf">more algebraic method</a> also exists, which may make more sense after we have completed this section.
</p>
<p>
  As with the previous sections, there is a list of algebraic properties—here, that’s Theorem 11.  Again, many of these are analogous to the algebra of multiplication you know, but there are some key differences that require attention.  I’ll go over these in class, but for now, note that property 1 tells us that the cross product is <em>anti</em>commutative.  Also, property 6 is of significant theoretical importance, but for the purposes of this class, it’s more like a technical lemma.  Some of you may use it in future classes, but you don’t need to memorize it for our exams, and you’ll rarely find use for it in the exercises.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–20, 27–43
</p>
<p>
  Computation is important, but the most valuable investment of your time might actually be in #13.  Make sure you understand that exercise in full, and let me know if you have any questions.
</p>
<p>
  Exercise #53 might also be interesting and useful to consider.
