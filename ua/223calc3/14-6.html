  You will not be responsible for the content of #43, but I recommend reading it and thinking about what it says.  You will sometimes hear me refer to the gradient of a function as “a kind of derivative”; the properties shown here are one of the reasons why.  I hasten to clarify that this is highly informal language: the gradient is not, in any strict sense, “the derivative” of the function.  It does, however, provide similar information and play a similar role to that of the ordinary derivative of a function of a single variable.
