<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 14.5: The Chain Rule</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.  You will not be required to identify by number which case a situation falls into; if you can construct the correct form of the Chain Rule by using a tree diagram or some other means, that is sufficient.  You will not be tested on the Implicit Function Theorem, but some of you may find it an easier way to approach implicit differentiation.  (I do not, as I prefer to memorize as little as possible, but if you struggle with the technique, you may find this helpful.)
