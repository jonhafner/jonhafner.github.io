<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 16.1: Vector Fields</h2>
<p>
  This is a relatively short and straightforward section, mostly spent drawing pictures of vector fields and calculating more gradients.  Read the text and carefully examine the figures; I don’t really have anything of value to add.  The exercises should be reasonably straightforward if you understand the concepts here—if you encounter difficulty or have any questions, let me know!
</p>
<p>
  (If the brief mention of conservative fields and potential functions is unclear, you can ignore it for now.  I don’t actually know why they introduce these terms at this point, since as far as I can tell, we don’t do anything with them until § 16.3.  I’ll explain more about them then.)
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–12 (or some sample thereof), 13–22, 25–34
</p>
<p>
  Exercises #35–36 are also good things to explore if you have access to software that will produce the plots specified.
