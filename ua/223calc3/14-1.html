<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 14.1: Functions of Several Variables</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.  (If you aren’t interested in economics and/or find the examples dealing with the Cobb-Douglas function to be difficult to understand, feel free to skim or skip those.)
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–16, 19–31, 35–38, 41–52, 55–56, 61–66
</p>
<p>
  (I believe we have mostly skipped the exercises explicitly addressing biology or economics, but if you have any interest in those, I encourage you to try them.)
