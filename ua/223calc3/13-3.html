<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 13.3: Arc Length and Curvature</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section, except possibly Torsion, which is a minor, optional topic.  It is a useful concept I encourage you to explore if you’re interested, but we don’t usually put much emphasis on it.
</p>
<p>
  The most useful formula for computing curvature is given by Theorem 10, and it should be commited to memory.  The others can be handy from time to time, but for practical purposes can be considered auxiliary.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–8, 15–29, 31–37, 42–43
</p>
<p>
  For some practice with the normal and binormal vectors and osculating circles, I recommend #51–56.  And as always, read the other exercises and try any you find interesting.
