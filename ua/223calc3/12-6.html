<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 12.6: Cylinders and Quadric Surfaces</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.  You do not need to memorize the entirety of Table 1: some surfaces are more important than others, and there are also some useful patterns we can extract.  I’ll point out the salient features in class.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–40
</p>
<p>
  Again, we will not ask you to sketch three-dimensional graphs for grading, but most of you will find these skills to be <em>very</em> useful later in the course, especially in Chapter 15.  (Sketching graphs is not usually strictly necessary, but being able to visualize the solid regions described can make many of those problems much easier.)  Toward that end, consider also working exercises #41–50 and 54–55 if you have the time and resources.  I also suggest you at least read #51–53, and perhaps work them out if you find them interesting.
