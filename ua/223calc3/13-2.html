<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 13.2: Derivatives and Integrals of Vector Functions</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.  Take note of the differentiation rules in Theorem 3: Properties 1 and 2 together tell us that differentiation of vector functions is a linear operatior, just like summations, limits, and the differentiation and integration of real-valued functions.  Properties 3–5 are product rules, one for each form of multiplication we have with vectors.  And as noted, Property 6 is a chain rule.
