<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>Old remote resources</h2>

<p>
  After our unplanned “remote” days, it occurred to me that my old COVID-era materials might be of use to some of you, especially if you have to miss class.  So, I’ve copied those notes into a subdirectory called “remote”; you can access them by slipping “<tt>remote/</tt>” into the URL for a section notes page, before the actual filename.  For example, the current notes for § 12.1 can be found at
</p>
<blockquote>
  <a href="12-1.html">https://www.hafner.us/ua/223calc3/12-1.html</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
  My old notes from 2021 Spring are now located at
</p>
<blockquote>
  <a href="remote/12-1.html">https://www.hafner.us/ua/223calc3/remote/12-1.html</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
  You can edit the URL for any other section similarly.  (Or alternatively, use the “remote” link above, but edit the chapter and section number to point to the page you want.  Either way.)
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Important caveats:</strong>  Never forget that these are old, outdated notes!  There are places where I have changed (improved, in my opinion) my presentations and explanations in the time since then; there are also occasions when I had better presentations even then, but I had to make compromises due to the circumstances.  These notes are from a semester in which I didn’t use WebAssign, so some references may be less relevant.  The videos are from the previous semester, 2020 Fall, in which I <em>did</em> use WebAssign, but the assignments were different back then, so if I mentioned any specific questions, assume those references are now incorrect.  There are probably broken links.  (In particular, I think the Panopto videos have been archived; probably just use YouTube.)
</p>
<p>
  In short, I really think you’ll have a much better experience coming to class, if at all possible.  However, if you must miss class, it’s probably better for you to have this than not, so here you are.  Use these resources with caution and discretion, and still get notes from a classmate if you can.
