<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 16.3: The Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals</h2>

<h3>The Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals</h3>
<p>
  This would be a good time to return to the very last topic in § 16.1, about conservative vector fields and potential functions.  These names are borrowed from physics, because a “conservative force” is one which conserves energy in an obvious way, and thus has a meaningful associated potential energy function.  (For example, gravity is conservative, while friction is not.)  In such circumstances, the force field is the negative of the gradient of the potential energy field.  We do not incorporate that negative sign here, and instead simply say that a conservative vector field is the gradient of its potential function.
</p>
<p>
  Thinking of the gradient as a kind of derivative, a potential function is sort of like an antiderivative of a vector field.  With that in mind, you can hopefully see that the Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals is very strongly analogous to the second part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: the integral of a “derivative” (gradient) is the difference of the “antiderivative” (potential) evaluated at the endpoints.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, only very rarely is a line integral to be evaluated already written as a gradient, just as in the previous two courses you were rarely asked to integrate a function written explicitly as a derivative.  More often, we need to <em>find</em> the antiderivative (or potential) of the integrand before we can use it.  For that to be on firm footing, we need a little bit of additional theory.
</p>

<h3>Independence of Path</h3>
<p>
  For the purposes of applications, the most important ideas to retain from this subsection are that
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    the line integral of a conservative vector field depends only on the initial and terminal points of the curve, not on the precise path followed to connect them; and consequently,
  </li>
  <li>
    the line integral of a conservative vector field over a <em>closed</em> path—i.e., one beginning and ending at the same point—is always zero.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Note that these are special properties of <em>conservative</em> vector fields: line integrals of non-conservative vector fields must be evaluated using the techniques of the previous section or one of the special theorems we will see in later sections.
</p>

<h3>Conservative Vector Fields and Potential Functions</h3>
<p>
  The beginning of this subsection uses Clairaut’s Theorem to deduce Theorem 5, a useful criterion we can check to determine whether a given vector field might be conservative.  If those mixed partials aren’t equal, there’s no point looking for a potential function, since it cannot exist.
</p>
<p>
  Once we decide a potential function is worth looking for, there are a couple ways we could go about it.  A thorough and rigorous method is demonstrated in the textbook; a quicker but “looser” method is to simply evaluate the appropriate partial integrals of some or all of the components of the vector field and use the results to reconstruct the potential.  I demonstrate both methods, followed by evaluation of an integral with the FTLI, in “§ 16.3a: FTLI with two variables (Exercise #30)” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxrNG4B2iLM">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://uakron.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=92a1cbe7-c8bc-4450-86b0-ac8300f29d1a">Panopto</a>) and “§ 16.3b: FTLI with three variables (Exercise #24)” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzAPAjbMvo">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://uakron.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=4060eeb5-9f8f-4588-9b46-ac8300f23b14">Panopto</a>).
