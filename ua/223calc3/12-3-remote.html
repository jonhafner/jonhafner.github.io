<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 12.3: The Dot Product — remote day</h2>

<p>
  A light introduction should do fine:  Read the definition and first example, as well as box 2, “Properties of the Dot Product”.  These properties are very important; make sure you understand them.  Following that box is a proof of two of the properties; reading that may help provide additional insight.  After that, perhaps try proving the rest for yourself.
</p>
<p>
  Unless you’d like to read ahead, you can stop when the discussion turns to angles—I want to go over that in class.  I’ll be using the Properties without restating them, though, so if you aren’t sure you can remember them, you might find it useful to copy them into your notes before Friday’s lecture.
