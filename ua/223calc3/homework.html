<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>Homework</h2>

<p>
  In this class, there are three primary types of “homework” in the broadest sense: <strong>Readings</strong>, <strong>WebAssign</strong>, and <strong>Suggested Exercises</strong>.
</p>



<h3>Readings</h3>
<p>
  The text is packed with more information than it is possible to present in class, so you should read each section before and/or after the corresponding lecture.  A common recommendation is to give each section at least a light skim <em>before</em> it’s covered in class, so you have some idea what to expect and hopefully find the lecture more understandable.  Whether you do that or not, you should also read the section thoroughly and carefully <em>after</em> we cover it in class.  Make sure to check my posted notes on each section; some sections have no special remarks about the suggested readings, but many do.
</p>
<p>
  You should also read the text for the alternate presentation of some concepts and techniques.  Everyone has their own mathematical style; mine sometimes agrees with Stewart’s, but often does not.  For any given topic, you may find my methods easier to use than Stewart’s, but you may also find the reverse.  Either way, the more perspectives you can get on a topic, usually the better.
</p>



<h3 id="webassign">WebAssign</h3>
<p>
  As mentioned in the syllabus, a portion of your grade will be based on assignments in WebAssign.  These are categorized as Homework and Quizzes, but the differences between them are relatively minor.  Quizzes tend to be shorter and simpler than homework assignments, and they limit you to only three attempts each (so you’ll want to exercise more care than you do with homework), but there are no special time limits or other access restrictions.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Grades:</strong>
  To see a summary of your current point totals in WebAssign, click “Grades” in the blue navigation bar, then click the “Raw Scores” link.  This should pop up a small window with your score totals.  (Only assignments whose due dates have passed should be counted here, automatically updated daily at 1am.)
</p>
<p>
  Most or all questions are worth 1 point each, regardless of which type of assignment they’re on; your point total across both categories will be used to calculate your grade.  For a quick estimate of where you currently stand, note that your average will be somewhere between your Homework and Quiz percentages, but closer to your Homework.  (Think of it as a weighted average, and note that there are usually about three or four times as many homework points as quiz points available.)  For a more precise calculation, add your total Scores from the two categories and divide that by the sum of the Max Possible points in the two categories.
</p>
<p>
  Note that this does not yet account for the “dropping” or “bonus point conversion”!  I'll adjust the total at the <em>end</em> of the semester, so your final WebAssign score will be slightly higher than what's shown here.
</p>



<h3 id="exercises">Suggested Exercises</h3>
<p>
  If you are anything like most students, you will need to work through a large number of exercises to gain proficiency with this material and become adequately prepared for the tests and the final exam.  You might find the online assignments sufficient for learning the material, but you might not.  You might find the difficulty ramping up too quickly, or you might feel that you still need more practice after completing an assignment.
</p>
<p>
  In each section’s notes, I include a list of suggested exercises based on Departmental resources from previous editions of the textbook.  These are a great place to start looking for additional practice.  (You will probably want to start with the odd-numbered problems in any given group so you can easily check your answers, then proceed to evens as needed.)
</p>
<p>
  However, that doesn’t mean you should stop there!  If you have time, strongly consider doing more exercises than those; at the very least, you should <em>read</em> all the exercises in the sections we cover, as some of them contain some very interesting ideas.  Also, keep in mind that the tests and exam will be conducted under strict time limits.  One of your goals with the exercises should be to acquire the skills to solve problems, first as reliably as possible, then as quickly as possible without sacrificing accuracy.  Toward that end, many of you may find it necessary to practice more exercises than just those suggested.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, always feel free to ask me questions if anything has you confused or concerned, even about these non-graded problems!  One of your goals should be to obtain mastery of the material, and one of my goals is to help you achieve that.
</p>
<p>
  As you work on these exercises (and the WebAssign questions also), I recommend that you neatly write out solutions in full, as if you were going to submit them for grading.  This is both to serve as a record for your own reference and to help you practice clear, correct mathematical writing.  Or if that is insufficient motivation, keep in mind that if you ask me for assistance on a problem that’s giving you trouble, I may need to see your work to figure out where you went wrong, but that won’t help if I can’t read it!
