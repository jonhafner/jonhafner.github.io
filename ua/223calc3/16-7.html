<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 16.7: Surface Integrals</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Parametric Surfaces:</strong>
  If you haven’t read § 16.6, you should skip most of this subsection.  You should read the last paragraph, however, describing how we can apply surface integrals to problems of masses of thin sheets.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Graphs of Functions:</strong>
  Without § 16.6, skip over the derivation of Formula 4, and just take that formula as basically the definition of a surface integral.  You can think of it as simply saying that you can evaluate a surface integral much like you would a surface area from § 15.5, except with an integrand in front of the radical.  Or equivalently, you can think of the old surface area formula (excluding the integral sign) as defining an expression for the differential surface area <i>dS</i>.  Be sure to read the paragraph immediately following Formula 4, which illustrates how to adapt it to surfaces other than <i>z</i> = <i>g</i>(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>).  Example 2 is a useful illustration, but skip Example 3 if you haven’t read § 16.6.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Oriented Surfaces:</strong>
  The preceding material is for surface integrals of scalar fields, i.e., real-valued functions.  To integrate a vector field over a surface, we need to be aware of the notion of orientation.  Read through this subsection to get the general idea, skipping the technical parts that don’t make sense to you.  In particular, if you haven’t read § 16.6, you might wish to ignore the portions dealing with a function <b>r</b>(<i>u</i>,<i>v</i>).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Surface Integrals of Vector Fields; Flux:</strong>
  Read the first portion of this section, up through Definition 8.  After that, if you haven’t read § 16.6, you can pass over the discussion and example with parametric surfaces and skip down to the paragraph containing Formula 10 for the version of use to us here.  (I personally find it easier to remember the form from one step back, which basically just says that <i>d</i><b>S</b> = ⟨−<i>z<sub>x</sub></i>,−<i>z<sub>y</sub></i>,1⟩<i>dA</i>.  Observe that with this notation, <i>dS</i> = |<i>d</i><b>S</b>|.)  Example 5 illustrates its application.  Continue reading after Example 5 to see applications to electric flux and heat flow.  The statement of Example 6 illustrates one such scenario, though its solution uses methods we won’t require of you.

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #9–12, 16–17, 23–24
</p>
<p>
  You can also try #13–15 if you feel up to making appropriate adjustments to the given formula to account for the different orientations.  (You might think of this as a rotation of the coördinate system, or as an appropriate interchange of variables.)
</p>
<p>
  If you’ve read § 16.6, you might also wish to try #5–8 and #21–22.
