<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 15.6: Triple Integrals</h2>
<p>
  Triple integrals are just like double integrals, except more so.  I say that somewhat facetiously, but it’s pretty accurate, as most of what you’ve done with double integrals extends to triple integrals in very natural ways.  The domains of integration are now three-dimensional regions in space, making the setup the hardest part of most of these.  Pay close attention to the examples, and see my example if necessary: “§ 15.6: Integral over a tetrahedron” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXP_u9smie4">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://uakron.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=5bcacdab-ed22-406b-981c-ac7801046d08">Panopto</a>).
</p>
<p>
  Some of you might initially have some trouble understanding what these integrals even <em>mean.</em>  Unless you have a unique ability to visualize four-dimensional objects and their hypervolumes, it won’t be productive to think of the integrand as a length; this is where other interpretations, such as density or temperature, are generally more intuitive.  If this is a sticking point for you, perhaps skip ahead to the subsection on “Applications of Triple Integrals” for several ways of interpreting them conceptually.

  <strong>Caution:</strong> In the eBook, Figures 16 and 17 appear to be duplicates of Figures 14 and 15, respectively.  If you have a printed copy of the text or an electronic version thereof, you have the correct figures; otherwise, <a href="15-6-Ex5.png">click here</a> for the correct version of Example 5.  (I just happened to notice this when skimming through, since the figure shown is obviously not a tetrahedron.  I’ve been teaching out of older editions of Stewart for quite some time, so I’m not reading every bit of this new one carefully; always let me know if you think you’ve found a mistake!)
</p>
<p>
  If you are becoming alarmed by the apparent trend of ever-increasing numbers of integrals, don’t worry!  Yes, the theory does extend to ℝ<sup><i>n</i></sup>, but unless you’re working in some sort of abstract state space, three or fewer integrals are enough to cover the <em>vast</em> majority of applications you’ll encounter—probably due to us inhabiting three spatial dimensions.  Certainly, for what we’re doing in this class, we cap out at triple integrals.

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–26, 31–46, 51–52
</p>
<p>
  Recall that I will not ask you to produce sketches for a grade, nor do I expect those to arise on the final exam; #31–32 are intended to help you develop skills that will be useful when you need to choose or change an order of integration, or to change to a different coördinate system / set of variables, as we will be doing extensively through the rest of this chapter.
</p>
<p>
  Also, take a look at the definition of average value given in the instructions for exercises #57–58; if you are uncertain whether you understand how that works, perhaps try those exercises.
