<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 15.6: Triple Integrals</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.
</p>
<!-- NB: Error in Figures 16 and 17 in the eBook has been corrected since last semester. -->

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–26, 31–46, 51–52
</p>
<p>
  Recall that I will not ask you to produce sketches for a grade, nor do I expect those to arise on the final exam; #31–32 are intended to help you develop skills that will be useful when you need to choose or change an order of integration, or to change to a different coördinate system / set of variables, as we will be doing extensively through the rest of this chapter.
</p>
<p>
  Also, take a look at the definition of average value given in the instructions for exercises #57–58; if you are uncertain whether you understand how that works, perhaps try those exercises.
