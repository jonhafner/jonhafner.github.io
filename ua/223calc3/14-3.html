<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 14.3: Partial Derivatives</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.
</p>
<p>
  The final subsection discusses Partial Differential Equations.  I should point out that we may ask you to check or confirm a possible solution to a PDE, but we will <em>not</em> ask you to obtain such a solution on your own.  That is the subject of much more advanced classes.  So for now, don’t worry about where such solutions come from—simply observe how we work with them.

  If you are interested in business or economics, you might be interested in the “Discovery Project” that follows this section.

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–34, 37–69
</p>
<p>
  Also, I recommend you read through #80–92 to get a sense for some of the applications of these ideas and techniques, and try any you find interesting.
