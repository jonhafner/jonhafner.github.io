<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>§ 2.1: Logical Form and Logical Equivalence</h2>

<!-- <h3><a href="2-1-handout.pdf">Handout (PDF)</a></h3> -->

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.  Note that the text includes more examples that are relevant to reasoning about mathematics and computer programming, which might help provide more context.
</p>
<p>
  You will need to eventually learn how to apply everything in Theorem 2.1.1, but I’m not too concerned about most of the names.  You should probably know the associative, commutative, distributive, and De Morgan’s laws by name, but the others I will not expect you to know the names of for in-class quizzes and exams.  You <em>will</em>, however, need to be able to apply those principles to manipulate logical expressions!
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Most of these are of use and/or interest; as before, perhaps start by doing the exercises with answers provided to make sure you understand the ideas, then proceed to as many more as you need to become comfortable.  This will probably be standard advice for much of the rest of the course.  (Exception: Starred exercises—in this section, those are #46 and #47—are significantly more challenging and/or deal with topics not core to our studies.  Unless I specify otherwise, feel free to skip those if you don’t feel up to them.)
</p>
<p>
  When writing truth tables, feel free to use 1 and 0 in place of T and F (respectively) if you wish.  You may find this easier, especially if you are already used to it from previous classes.
</p>
<p>
  The exercises which appear to be most similar to possible test questions include #6–10, 12–37, and 48–54.  Strictly speaking, if something like #48 or #49 appears on a test, it would most likely be presented in the style of #50–54—i.e., with no intermediate steps given, instead asking you to supply them.  But again, I will <em>not</em> ask you to cite each law applied by name as you are instructed in these exercises.  You should do so when studying, as it helps avoid sloppy thinking, but on in-class assessments, I’m more interested in testing your ability to <em>apply</em> the laws.
  Also, for #50–54 (and others like them), remember to do only a single thing in each step, and cite the law used in that step by name.
