<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>§ 9.2: Possibility Trees and the Multiplication Rule</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  As usual, most are potentially useful.  Those that look like plausible test questions include #8–17 and 32–39.
</p>
<!-- <p>NB: Restore if Ch.7 in pulled back out of the curriculum, but as it stands, there's only the most basic bit of relations involved here; the rest should be doable now.
  Exercises #21–22 rely upon an understanding of functions, relations, domains, and ranges—topics covered in Chapters 7 and 8, which we skipped.  If you feel familiar enough with those concepts already (or are up to a bit of research), I recommend trying these exercises; otherwise, feel free to skip them.
