<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>§ 1.1: Variables</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.  Particularly note the last paragraph, which gives an example of the kinds of logically complex statements found throughout mathematics.  (The particular example given is a definition of one of several kinds of limits, which are dealt with in calculus.)
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Do as many of #1–6 and 8–13 as you find useful.  Once you feel comfortable with these ideas, try #7.  (Recall that we did #7(b) in class; you may find it helpful to consult your notes.)
</p>
<p>
  For additional practice, try to determine which type of statement is given in each exercise: universal, conditional, existential, universal conditional, universal existential, or existential universal.  This will help prepare you for the analysis we will be doing in Chapter&nbsp;2.  (You do not need to concern yourself with memorizing all of these at this stage—feel free to consult the descriptions and examples given in the main body of the section.)
</p>
<p>
  N.B.: Throughout the course, you might find it helpful to begin with those exercises whose answers are given so you can check yourself, proceeding to the black-numbered exercises afterward for additional practice.  (In the eBook, look for those exercises with “Answer” buttons.  In the printed text or digital copies thereof, exercises with numbers printed in blue have answers in Appendix&nbsp;B.)
