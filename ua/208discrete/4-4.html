<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>§ 4.4: Direct Proof and Counterexample IV: Divisibility</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  As usual, most are potentially useful.  I recommend attempting #44–49, but even if you do not, at least read them, then try #36.  Divisibility rules are often very useful!
</p>
<p>
  Those that look like plausible test questions include #1–13, 15–17, and 20–31.
