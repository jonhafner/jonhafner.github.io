<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>§ 4.2: Direct Proof and Counterexample II: Writing Advice</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section, as it contains valuable guidance on how to write good proofs.  In fact, I would recommend returning to review this section from time to time as you continue to study proofs over the course of the following sections and chapters, as some things that might not stick right now will make more sense once you’ve gotten a bit more experience.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  As usual, most are potentially useful.  Those that look like plausible test questions include #1–14 and 20–30.
