<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>§ 6.1: Set Theory: Definitions and the Element Method of Proof</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section (though the algorithm at the end is optional).
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  As usual, most are potentially useful.  Those that look like plausible test questions include #1–5, 10–15, 18–33 (except 31(d) and 32(b)), and 35.
</p>
<p>
  For #11–12, I suggest beginning by translating the given sets into interval notation, and also using interval notation to write your answers.  If you are not yet comfortable with it, this will help provide you with the practice you need; when you are comfortable, you should find this to be much faster and easier than the set-builder form!
</p>
<p>
  Part (d) of #31 and part (b) of #32 are quite tedious.  It might be useful to start each of them, but once you see how the rest of it would go, feel free to move on as soon as you get bored.  Similarly for #34: it might be worth doing a little bit of each part so you can compare and contrast the forms, but working them out in their entirety is cumbersome.
</p>
<p>
  If you chose not to read the algorithm at the end of the section, skip #36–38.
