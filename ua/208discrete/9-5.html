<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>§ 9.5: Counting Subsets of a Set: Combinations</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.
</p>
<!-- Previously, I had a note advising students that they may skim or skip the last 2½ pages, but the material on partitions and Stirling numbers appears to have been cut from 5e entirely! -->

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  As usual, most are potentially useful.  Those that look like plausible test questions include #5–10, 12–14, 16–17, and 19–20.
</p>
<p>
  #11 is excellent practice, but not very practical for in-class assessments.  Some hands would be simple enough to compute, but I would have to explain a great deal even for them, since you are not expected to know the rules of poker!  I strongly suggest trying this exercise if you’re up to it, but if you find this business about poker hands confusing or unpleasant, feel free to skip it.
</p>
<p>
  #25–27 rely upon information about functions and relations from Chapters 7 and 8, which we skipped.  Feel free to do the same unless the terms used make sense to you.
