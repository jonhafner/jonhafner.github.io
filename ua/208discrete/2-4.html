<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>§ 2.4: Application: Digital Logic Circuits</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.  In the closing subsection, note that the use of the Sheffer stroke | for NAND conflicts with an alternative notation for OR that I supplied in § 2.1: the vertical bar | is used for OR in many common programming languages, including most of those which are C-like.  This is an excellent example of the prevalence of conflicting notations, the importance of always checking the conventions of whatever context you’re working in, and the need to be adaptable to different circumstances.  Be sure to seek understanding of the underlying concepts rather than relying purely on memorization of specific representations.

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  #1–32 are standard exercises; as usual, start with those with answers, and do as many more as are useful.  #5–17 appear most similar to possible test questions.  (<strong>NB:</strong> For #5–12 in the eBook, ignore the “input signals” given beneath the circuit diagrams; they appear to be spurious duplications, relevant only to #1–4.  The printed text and digital versions thereof do not have this problem.)
</p>
<p>
  I expect #33–34 will be of use to those of you studying Computer Engineering, but the rest of you can feel free to skip them unless you want extra practice.
</p>
<p>
  Keep in mind throughout that even when not requested, an I/O table or a Boolean expression might be a useful tool when trying to construct a circuit.  In particular, a Boolean expression can be simplified symbolically with the aid of Theorem 2.1.1.
