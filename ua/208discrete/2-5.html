<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>§ 2.5: Application: Number Systems and Circuits for Addition</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.  In particular, the text has more thorough and rigorous explanations of the construction of adder circuits and the properties of two’s complement.<!-- For 4e errata, see old notes -->
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Those that look like plausible test questions include #1–20, 23–36, 38–40 (except with smaller values to be faster without calculators), and 41–46.  With the possible exception of #38–40, you should be able to do all the required arithmetic by hand; if you use a calculator at all, it should only be as a check.  Notes:
  <ul>
    <li>In #17–20, feel free to either subtract directly (borrowing as needed) or add the two’s complement of the subtrahend, as you prefer.</li>
    <li>Feel free to skip #37(b) unless you want to dig deeper into the theory behind two’s complement.</li>
    <li>Side note on #47: Just as hexadecimal can be thought of as a shorthand for binary in four-bit chunks, octal translates binary in three-bit chunks.  That might sound less useful—when do we care about precisely three bits?—but it is occasionally handy.  One of the most common applications is probably the use of <code>chmod</code> and the like to set the read/<wbr>write/<wbr>execute permissions for files in Unix-like operating systems, with the digits 4–7 representing the most frequently used options on single-user systems.  (Can you see why?)</li>
  </ul>
