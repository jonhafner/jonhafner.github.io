<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>§ 9.1: Introduction to Probability</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section (including chapter intro).
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  As usual, most are potentially useful.  Those that look like plausible test questions include #2–10.
</p>
<p>
  Be sure to at least read #11–15, as they collectively illustrate a very important point.  Also, some of the later exercises (#23–27 explicitly, perhaps up through #32 a bit more broadly) apply to computer programming, so many of you may find it useful to take a look at those.
</p>
<p>
  #33 is starred, but it is not as difficult as many other starred exercises—rather, it is a relatively straightforward induction problem, albeit in a new context.  I recommend trying it.
