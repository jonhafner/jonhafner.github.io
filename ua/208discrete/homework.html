<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>Homework</h2>

<p>
  In this class, there are three primary types of “homework” in the broadest sense: <strong>Readings</strong>, <strong>Exercises</strong>, and <strong>Graded Problems</strong>.
</p>



<h3>Readings</h3>
<p>
  The text is packed with more information than it is possible to present in class, so you should read each section before and/or after the corresponding lecture.  A common recommendation is to give each section at least a light skim <em>before</em> it’s covered in class, so you have some idea what to expect and hopefully find the lecture more understandable.  Whether you do that or not, you should also read the section thoroughly and carefully <em>after</em> we cover it in class.  Make sure to check my posted notes on each section; some sections have no special remarks about the suggested readings, but many do.
</p>
<p>
  You should also read the text for the alternate presentation of some concepts and techniques.  Everyone has their own mathematical style; mine sometimes agrees with Epp’s, but often does not.  For any given topic, you may find you prefer one of those over the other, but either way, the more perspectives you can get on a topic, usually the better.
</p>



<h3 id="exercises">Exercises</h3>
<p>
  If you are anything like most students, you will need to work through a large number of exercises to gain proficiency with this material and become adequately prepared for the tests and the final exam.  In each section’s notes, I include a list of suggested exercises to help guide your studies.  Do as many as you need develop your skills.  You should also <em>read</em> all the exercises in the sections we cover, suggested or not, as some of them contain some very interesting ideas.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, always feel free to ask me questions if anything has you confused or concerned, even about these non-graded problems!  One of your goals should be to obtain mastery of the material, and one of the most important parts of my job is to help you achieve that.
</p>
<p>
  As you work on these exercises, I recommend that you neatly write out solutions in full, as if you were going to submit them for grading.  This is both to serve as a record for your own reference and to help you practice clear, correct mathematical writing.  Or if that is insufficient motivation, keep in mind that if you ask me for assistance on a problem that’s giving you trouble, I may need to see your work to figure out where you went wrong, but that won’t help if I can’t read it!
</p>



<h3 id="graded">Graded Problems</h3>
<p>
  I will assign a number of homework problems throughout the course—on average, probably about one problem for every two or three sections, give or take.  This is a tentative plan, so don’t hold me to that precisely; I don’t have them all worked out yet.  Problems assigned for a grade will be added to <a href="hw.pdf">this PDF</a> as they are determined.  Due dates will typically be set for approximately one week after the corresponding material is covered in class.
</p>
<p>
  A typical graded problem will be more demanding in some way than the typical test or exam question: it may be too long or too difficult to squeeze onto a test, or it may require more cleverness than is reasonable to expect of you under tight time constraints.  Alternatively, a problem might not be particularly challenging but may instead be assigned as homework because it requires the use of a calculator or computer, or some other resource not available to you during a test or exam.  In any case, <em>before</em> attempting these assignments, you should work a number of exercises to prepare (see above), as diving straight into the graded problem is probably not an efficient way to learn.  That said, you should try to work ahead and get to the graded problems as soon as you comfortably can, for reasons explained under “Resubmission”, below.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>General instructions:</strong>
  Solve the given problems as directed.  Problems will have the relative weight indicated, with most problems being worth around 5–15 points, and partial credit awarded at my discretion.  You are strongly encouraged to discuss these ideas with your classmates and your instructor, and to consult other resources, but all written work must be your own.  Ensure that your solutions are legible and organized.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Submission:</strong>
  Unless you have an interest in learning proper mathematical typography, I recommend that you write your solutions by hand rather than typing them.  Hard (paper) copies are preferable, if circumstances permit, but digital submissions are also perfectly acceptable.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Physical submission:</strong>  If you use paper from a spiral-bound notebook, remove the torn “fringes” from the edge—they tend to get tangled with other papers, creating problems during the process of sorting, grading, resorting, and recording.  Similarly, if your solution takes more than one sheet of paper, firmly fasten them together with a staple, paper clip, piece of tape, etc., so they are not easily separated.  In any case, remember to write your name at the top of the front side of each paper.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Digital submission:</strong>  If written on paper, you can scan or photograph your work; if you have a device supporting pen or stylus input, that may be another option.  In any case, digital submissions should be emailed to me as attachments, either in PDF or a common image format.  <strong>Do not</strong> send files in proprietary or uncommon formats, such as <code>.docx</code> or HEIC.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Your submissions are due by the end of class on the day specified.  Late work will be accepted solely at my discretion.  If I have it before I finish grading, it’s probably fine; however, once I finish grading a problem and move on from it, I will grade no more of that item.  So, if you are not finished on time, get it in as soon as you can and hope for the best.  (Of course, even if a submission is too late to be worth credit, I can still give you feedback on your work.)
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Grading:</strong>
  Because of the additional resources at your disposal (such as your notes, textbook, classmates, instructor, the Internet, and time), as well as the opportunity to improve your scores (see below), homework problems will be graded much more harshly than test problems.  One of the stated objectives of this course is to teach you how to clearly and effectively communicate with written mathematics.  Some leniency may be allowed on tests and exams, when time is short, but on homework, you can expect to lose points for even minor errors in notation or style.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Resubmission:</strong>
  The graded homework problems I assign are partly for the purpose of assessment, but mainly to help you develop your mastery of the material.  Toward that end, you may submit revised solutions to a problem up until the deadline, and I will retain only your highest score in my records.  For this reason, you should try to submit your work as early as possible, so I can give you feedback with enough time for revisions.  (Even after the deadline has passed, I encourage you to submit revisions to confirm that you have correctly worked out whatever you missed, even though they will be worth no credit at that point.)
</p>
<p>
  Because of this option, my feedback may sometimes be terse or vague; this is intended to nudge you in the right direction while still allowing you the opportunity to do some refinement on your own.  Please ask me for more details if you do not understand what you did wrong or how you should improve, and I’ll be happy to provide you with further clarification until you have the information you need.
