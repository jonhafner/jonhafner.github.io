<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>§ 4.7: Indirect Argument: Contradiction and Contraposition</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.  Give special consideration to the final subsection, “Proof as a Problem-Solving Tool”.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  As usual, most are potentially useful.  Those that look like plausible test questions include #2–7, 12–19, and 23–29.  Be sure to at least read #31–34, and work as much of them as you can; these are very useful things to be familiar with!
