<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>§ 6.3: Disproofs and Algebraic Proofs</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  As usual, most are potentially useful.
  <!-- Cut when I put the chapters in order; restore this note if I go back to teaching 6 before 5:
  (In addition to being marked as more challenging, #26 also requires material from Chapter 5, so unless you have worked with sequences, series, and mathematical induction in the past, you should probably skip it for now, and perhaps return to it later if you’re interested.)
  -->
  Those that look like plausible test questions include #1–22, 31–38 (without citation of laws by name, but perhaps just asked to simplify, as in 41–43), and 46–50 (with the definition given—you don’t have to memorize the symmetric difference!).
