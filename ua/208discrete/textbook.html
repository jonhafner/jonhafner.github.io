<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>Textbook and WebAssign</h2>

<p>
  The textbook will be your primary resource for this course.  It’s packed with useful information, illustrations, examples, and references.  I will post notes to help guide you through the readings, and the bulk of my lectures will be designed to supplement (with additional examples) or complement (with alternate viewpoints) the textbook; I cannot replace it.  I myself learned this subject from 2nd edition Epp, and its modern descendants are even more thorough and extensive.  This text isn’t perfect, but it is the best one I’ve seen for this subject.  (Or at least, its <em>content</em> is, as is its printed form; the presentation of the online eBook version is perhaps not optimal.  See below for other options.)
</p>

<h3>WebAssign</h3>
<p>
  The eBook is only one portion of a broader system called WebAssign, which includes a variety of assessment tools and other resources.  I am not attaching any sort of points or grades to anything in WebAssign; it is a <strong>strictly optional</strong> resource.  Feel free to use it as much or as little as you please.  Most sections have one or more “assignments” that were provided by the publisher, if you find such things helpful.  (I must stress that those were put together by Cengage, not by myself or anyone else at UAkron.  If a question seems particularly strange to you, feel free to check with me to confirm how relevant it is to our course.)  In addition to those assessments, it also has an extensive library of videos and other resources.

<h3>Access to WebAssign and the eBook</h3>
<p>
  As described in the <a href="syllabus-policies.pdf">syllabus</a>, if you are registered in this course, you should have access to a digital copy of the textbook via WebAssign.  Following are instructions from the bookstore for enabling or ensuring that access:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>You must confirm your book order here:  <a href="https://www.uakron.edu/bookbundle/">https://www.uakron.edu/bookbundle/</a>.  Scroll down and then click “Very Your Order”</li>
    <li>Click the e-book link in Brightspace.</li>
    <li>You will be asked to complete registration, which you should do.  You do not need to pay.  You can now access the e-book and any other publisher resources available for this class.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>*If a student would like to opt out of the all-in bundle they can do so here:  <a href="https://www.uakron.edu/bookbundle">https://www.uakron.edu/bookbundle</a> scroll down to “can I opt-out of the program”. If the student opts out, they will be responsible for purchasing the material on their own through the bookstore (<a href="https://shopakronzips.com">shopakronzips.com</a>) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Once you are enrolled and everything is set up, when you log into <a href="https://brightspace.uakron.edu">Brightspace</a> and navigate to this course, you should see a panel in the left sidebar called “Content Browser”.  There, under “Course Materials”, you can click the link “Cengage WebAssign” to access WebAssign and the eBook.  (This might also be the “e-book link in Brightspace” mentioned above?  Instructions are unclear.)
</p>
<p>
  For technical assistance, consult the <a href="https://www.cengage.com/help-center/">Cengage help and support center</a>.  (If you encounter difficulties, before contacting tech support, first make sure you have disabled your browser’s pop-up blocker for the site, as this seems to be the most common source of problems.)
</p>

<h3>Deciding whether to retain or opt out of the ALL-IN Book Bundle</h3>
<p>
  First, if you have other courses requiring materials available through this bundle, you should probably keep it.
</p>
<p>
  Otherwise, there are a couple situations in which you might want to opt out of this arrangement to recover the fee charged to you.  Chiefly, if you already have access through some other means, such as a Cengage Unlimited subscription, you should probably opt out of this program to avoid paying extra.
</p>
<p>
  You might also wish to opt out if you already have a copy of the textbook or are able to find one at a good price, and you are not particularly interested in the eBook’s video examples and the other resources WebAssign offers.  See below for my recommendations on which editions of the textbook will serve your needs.
</p>

<h3>Textbook Versions</h3>
<p>
  The assigned textbook for this course is <em>Discrete Mathematics with Applications</em>, 5th Edition, by Susanna S. Epp.  A digital “eBook” version is available through WebAssign, as described above, but if your only access is digital, I would personally recommend picking up a physical copy of the text for convenience.  (The print version also has superior layout and typography.)<!--  The UA bookstore should have loose-leaf copies at a discounted price, hole-punched for insertion into a three-ring binder.  Some of you may find that to be a convenient format.-->
  <!-- NB: I used to also say that the print version has "fewer errors", but they do seem to have implemented most of the errata at least, so I'm no longer certain that's true? -->
</p>
<p>
  If you wish to seek a cheaper used copy, older editions should work fine.  In particular, my own notes are adapting from the 4th edition, so I can help you with the differences upon request.  If you are using a still older version, let me know, and I'll see what I can do.  Do <strong>not</strong> buy the edition marked “In Brief”!
