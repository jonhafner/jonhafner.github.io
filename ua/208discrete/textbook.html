<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>Textbook and WebAssign</h2>

<p>
  The textbook will be your primary resource for this course.  It’s packed with useful information, illustrations, examples, and references.  I will post notes to help guide you through the readings, and the bulk of my lectures will be designed to supplement (with additional examples) or complement (with alternate viewpoints) the textbook; I cannot replace it.  I myself learned this subject from 2nd edition Epp, and its modern descendants are even more thorough and extensive.  This text isn’t perfect, but it is the best one I’ve seen for this subject.  (Or at least, its <em>content</em> is, as is its printed form; the presentation of the online eBook version is perhaps not optimal.  See below for other options.)
</p>

<h3>WebAssign</h3>
<p>
  The eBook is only one portion of a broader system called WebAssign, which includes a variety of assessment tools and other resources.  I am not attaching any sort of points or grades to anything in WebAssign; it is a <strong>strictly optional</strong> resource.  Feel free to use it as much or as little as you please.  Most sections have one or more “assignments” that were provided by the publisher, if you find such things helpful.  (I must stress that those were put together by Cengage, not by myself or anyone else at UAkron.  If a question seems particularly strange to you, feel free to check with me to confirm how relevant it is to our course.)  In addition to those assessments, it also has an extensive library of videos and other resources.
</p>

<h3>Access to WebAssign and the eBook</h3>
<p>
  As described in the <a href="syllabus-policies.pdf">syllabus</a>, if you are registered in this course, you should have access to a digital copy of the textbook via WebAssign.  When you log into <a href="https://brightspace.uakron.edu">Brightspace</a> and navigate to this course, you should see a panel in the left sidebar called “Content Browser”.  One link reads “WebAssign and eBook Access”; if you click that, it should expand into a collection of links through which you can register for and access WebAssign and the eBook.
</p>

  For more information on getting started in WebAssign, see <a href="https://startstrong.cengage.com/webassign-brightspace-ia-yes/">this guide</a>.<!--  A representative from the publisher will also be hosting some “office hours” on Zoom from January 10 through February 2 for any UAkron students who have questions about how to register and get started.-->

<h3>Opting out of Inclusive Access</h3>
<p>
  There are a couple situations in which you might want to opt out of this arrangement to recover the fee charged to you.  First and foremost, if you already have access through some other means, such as a Cengage Unlimited subscription, you should probably opt out of this program to avoid paying extra.
</p>
<p>
  You might also wish to opt out if you already have a copy of the textbook or are able to find one at a good price, and you are not particularly interested in the eBook’s video examples and the other resources WebAssign offers.  See below for my recommendations on which editions of the textbook will serve your needs.
</p>
<p>
  If you do wish to opt out, or you would just like more information about the “Inclusive Access” program, click the “Course Materials” link in the Content Browser sidebar, then “Course Materials (First Day)”.
</p>

<h3>Textbook Versions</h3>
<p>
  The assigned textbook for this course is <em>Discrete Mathematics with Applications</em>, 5th Edition, by Susanna S. Epp.  A digital “eBook” version is available through WebAssign, as described above, but if your only access is digital, I would personally recommend picking up a physical copy of the text for convenience.  (The print version also has superior layout and typography.)<!--  The UA bookstore should have loose-leaf copies at a discounted price, hole-punched for insertion into a three-ring binder.  Some of you may find that to be a convenient format.-->
  <!-- NB: I used to also say that the print version has "fewer errors", but they do seem to have implemented the errata at least, so I'm no longer certain that's true? -->
</p>
<p>
  If you wish to seek a cheaper used copy, older editions should work fine.  In particular, my own notes are adapting from the 4th edition, so I can help you with the differences upon request.  If you are using a still older version, let me know, and I'll see what I can do.  Do <strong>not</strong> buy the edition marked “In Brief”!
