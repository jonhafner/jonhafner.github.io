<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>§ 4.1: Direct Proof and Counterexample I: Introduction</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  First, remember to read the chapter introduction!  It does a resonable job, I feel, of conveying some of the goals and motivations behind the direction we’re heading in.  After that, proceed to read this section in its entirety.

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  As usual, most are potentially useful.  Those that look like plausible test questions include #12–20.
