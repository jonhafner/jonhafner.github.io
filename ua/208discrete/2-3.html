<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  As usual, start with those with answers, and do as many more as are useful.  By the end, you should be able to recognize and apply all the standard rules of inference given in this section.  (It’s okay if you have to check the table for their names; other than modus ponens and modus tollens, I don’t expect you to remember all those names.  However, you <em>do</em> need to internalize the forms, of course.)

<p>
  The exercises which appear to be most similar to possible test questions include #1–21, 24, and 27–30.  Due to the time required for reading and the possibility of ambiguity in language, I am unlikely to ask questions like #36–40 on in-class quizzes or exams.  However, they are very good ways to hone your skills, so I very strongly recommend working through all of them.  (Besides, they can be fun!)
