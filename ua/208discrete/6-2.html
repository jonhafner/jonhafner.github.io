<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>§ 6.2: Properties of Sets</h2>

<h3><a href="6-2-handout.pdf">Handout</a></h3>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.  In Theorem 6.2.2, much as with Theorem 2.1.1, you should know the commutative, associative, distributive, and De Morgan’s laws by name, but I will not expect you to memorize the names of all the others.  Again, though, you do need to internalize these to the point where you can <em>use</em> them whenever needed.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  As usual, most are potentially useful.  (Hint for #18: Write down the formal definition of subset, then write its contrapositive; recall that these are logically equivalent.)  Those that look like plausible test questions include #5, 7–8, 14–17, 19–22, and 28–38.
