<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>Remote lecture for § 2.3: Valid and Invalid Arguments</h2>

<p><strong>N.B.:</strong>  Remember to consult my usual <a href="2-3.html">notes for this section</a> for commentary on the exercises!</p>

<h3>Modus Ponens and Modus Tollens</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Section 001 (CBA):</strong>  Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAiFbIiNRBc">this video</a>, using exercise #5 for a quick example.  [If you’re in section 002 (MGH) and were in class on Friday, you can safely skip this video unless you’d like the refresher.]
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Both sections:</strong>  For an additional, more thorough example of using a truth table to check the validity of an argument form, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsJn22kPXWM">see this video</a>.
</p>

<h3>Additional Valid Argument Forms: Rules of Inference</h3>
<p>
  Read through this portion of the text, thinking carefully about why each argument form is valid.  If it’s not clear, a truth table may help; if you still don’t have an intuition for a particular rule after that, talk to me about it.
</p>
<p>
  Some of these rules can be thought of as “utilities”, not seeming to do much on their own but useful as part of a longer chain of reasoning.  (I feel like Generalization, Specialization, and Conjunction are good examples of this type.)
</p>
<p>
  Others, though, more closely resemble what we might already think of as logical reasoning.  Elimination, for instance, is associated with what is commonly called “the process of elimination”.  Proof by Division into Cases is the formal structure of a proof technique we will apply to number theory in § 4.5, and the Contradiction Rule (introduced near the end of the section) will be useful to us starting in § 4.7.
</p>
<p>
  To illustrate the application of these rules to a more complex argument, I work through exercise #42 in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAjLNW-Zwr0">this video</a>.  Either before or after this, you may wish to read Example 2.3.8, which is of a similar type but less abstract and a good bit simpler.  For both of these, you might wish to have a collected summary of the rules of inference on hand for quick and easy reference; a table of them can be found at the end of this section, right before the exercises.
</p>

<h3>Fallacies</h3>
<p>
  Read this section carefully.  Presently, the fallacies of greatest interest to us are converse and inverse error, which are examples of <strong>formal fallacies</strong>—it is the <em>form</em> or <em>structure</em> of the argument that is invalid, permitting false conclusions.  In other settings, however, you are much more likely to encounter <strong>informal fallacies</strong>, where the problem is not the form but the content; these include using ambiguous premises or circular reasoning/<wbr><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question">begging the question</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Pay close attention to the concept of a <strong>sound</strong> argument, and how this differs from whether an argument is <strong>valid</strong>.  (In particular, observe that if you see an argument with an obviously false conclusion, you know it’s not sound, but it may still be valid!)
</p>

<h3>Contradictions and Valid Arguments</h3>
<p>
  Read this section also, though it is less relevant to in-class tests.  The example illustrates how these principles can be applied to solve more complex logic problems.  The example is of the classic “knights and knaves” type, but see the exercises for some other fun puzzles.
