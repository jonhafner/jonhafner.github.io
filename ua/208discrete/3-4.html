<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>§ 3.4: Arguments with Quantified Statements</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Most of the section.  If you haven’t elected to study Tarski’s World (§ 3.1), skip Example 3.4.8.  Pay special attention to the final subsection, which partly explains why converse and inverse errors are so common and insidious, but also sometimes useful.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  As usual, most are potentially useful.  Those that look like plausible test questions include #7–19 and 21–27.  If you have taken or will take Calculus II, I suggest paying special attention to #17–18.  Exercises #31–34 are excellent for refining your skills, but they are beyond what I will ask you to do.
