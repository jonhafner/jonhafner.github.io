<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>§ 5.1: Sequences</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section, though the application at the end is optional.  Note that this section contains a large number of diverse properties and examples, some of which we had to skip in lecture for the sake of time.  Review it carefully!
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Algorithm for converting between number bases:</strong>  The final subsection is strictly optional—you won’t be asked about it in this class—but some of you may find it very interesting and/or useful.  However, I feel that it’s not well explained, and it doesn’t help that the book’s diagram of the divisions uses a very strange layout.  I put together a brief animation illustrating how we would normally do this by hand; this is to replace or clarify the first diagram in the example of converting 38 to binary.

  Note that there’s nothing “special” about converting decimal to binary with this method; exercise #87 asks you to devise a similar method for converting to hexadecimal, and you can really convert between any two bases this way as long as you know how to divide in the original base.

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  As usual, most are potentially useful.  Those that look like plausible test questions include #1–6, 10–16, 18–28, 43–52, and 62–76.  (I won’t explicitly ask questions like #29–42 and 53–61, but they exercise skills that will be important later, so do not neglect them!)
