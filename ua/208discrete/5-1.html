<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>§ 5.1: Sequences</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section, though the application at the end is optional.  Note that this section contains a large number of diverse properties and examples, some of which we had to skip in lecture for the sake of time.  Review it carefully!
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  As usual, most are potentially useful.  Those that look like plausible test questions include #1–6, 10–16, 18–28, 43–52, and 62–76.  (I won’t explicitly ask questions like #29–42 and 53–61, but they exercise skills that will be important later, so do not neglect them!)
