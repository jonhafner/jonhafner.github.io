<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.  (We skipped Chapter 7, so if you are not comfortable with the formalities of functions, feel free to skip over the proofs of the theorems.)
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  You will not be tested on this section, but its ideas are important to be aware of and generally understood.  Do as many exercises as you find interesting and/or useful for your own development.
