<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>§&nbsp;7.2: One-to-One, Onto, and Inverse Functions</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.  Strictly speaking, “Application: Hash Functions” is optional, but still recommended as an example of important practical applications.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  As usual, most are potentially useful.  Those that look like plausible test questions include #10–13, 20, 28–29, and 44–49, but do not neglect the earlier exercises building up fundamental skills.
