<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>§ 3.3: Statements with Multiple Quantifiers</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Most of the section.  If you haven’t elected to study Tarski’s World (§ 3.1), skip the examples related to it (1, 2, 8, 9, and 10), but do be sure to read the surrounding text.  Similarly, you may skip the last subsection, on the programming language Prolog, if you wish.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  As usual, most are potentially useful.  Those that look like plausible test questions include #11–19 and 41.  If you would like to play around with the uncommon notation I mentioned for “there exists a unique”, take a look at exercises #44–45, but you won’t be responsible for that.
  <!-- The preceding sentence is written that way because I've already mentioned it in class, not being able to remember whether it was in the text anywhere.  If I haven't mentioned it, revert to the old version: "I suggest paying special attention to #44–45, which introduce an uncommon but very interesting notation!" -->
  If you aren’t interested in Tarski’s World or Prolog, skip the exercises referencing these topics (specifically, #5–8, 20, 25–28, 46–54, and 59–61).
