<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>§ 5.2: Mathematical Induction I: Proving Formulas</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.  Pay special attention to the material on sums of geometric sequences, which I skip in class for time, and the subsection titled “Proving an Equality”, which explains why we are very particular about how we handle equations in proofs.  (You might notice that I tend to favor method (2) when possible; this is preferred in most contexts.)
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  As usual, most are potentially useful.  Those that look like plausible test questions include #6–17 and 20–29 (with relevant formulae provided).
