<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>§ 3.1: Predicates and Quantified Statements I</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Most of the section.  The last subsection introduces a system called Tarski’s World; feel free to skip this (and any exercises which reference it) if you wish.  If it interests you or you desire additional practice, by all means explore it, but I won’t ask you any questions about it or use it for any examples in class.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  As usual, most are potentially useful.  (If you aren’t interested in Tarski’s World, skip #27.)  Those that look like plausible test questions include #3–4, 7–14, 16–19, 28–30, and 32–33.
