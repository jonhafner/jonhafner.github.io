<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>Remote lecture for § 2.5: Application: Number Systems and Circuits for Addition (part 1)</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  Read the section intro carefully.  Do not start skimming because it reminds you of grade school: it’s important to make sure you <em>really understand</em> the decimal number system and the terminology associated with it.  We’re going to build on this in our discussion of other number systems.
</p>
<p>
  Across cultures, many number systems treat the number ten with some significance, probably because we happen to have ten fingers.  Even cultures that didn’t use positional numeral systems were often built from tens or groups of tens; see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals">Roman numerals</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_numerals">Greek numerals</a> for two different methods in this vein.
</p>
<p>
  However, systems built on other bases have also existed.  The English terms <em>dozen</em> (12), <em>gross</em> (144 = 12²), and <em>great gross</em> (1728 = 12³) suggest a duodecimal or “dozenal” system.  Some systems are based on twenties; Mayan numerals are the most famous example of this, but we also see remnants of such a system in French, and other examples abound.  Even in English we have the word <em>score</em>, as in “Four score and seven years ago”.  The ancient Babylonians used a base-60 system (though it sort of had a base-10 system embedded within it); the adoption of Babylonian methods by Greek astronomers is why we have 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 360° in a full turn.
</p>
<p>
  These are interesting historical curiosities, but of interest to us here are those number systems which are most useful for digital computers, and due to their yes/no, on/off, true/false nature, those of greatest application tend to have bases which are powers of 2.  Most commonly, we are interested in base 2 (which we call <em>binary</em>) and base 16 (<em>hexadecimal</em>), though base 8 (<em>octal</em>) also sees some use, as do others.  (Bases 32 and 64 are sometimes used to represent binary data as compactly as possible in plain ASCII, for instance.)  So, this brings us to the first subsection:
</p>

<h3>Binary Representation of Numbers</h3>
<p>
  The text does a good job of introducing how the binary number system works, though it doesn’t make entirely explicit that the common term “bit” originated as a contraction of “<strong>bi</strong>nary dig<strong>it</strong>”.  Read the discussion and examples, and if you want to see more “live” examples, you can watch and listen as I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZYJlvwa6_I">convert a decimal number to binary</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zODW3AkiooU">convert a binary number to decimal</a>.
</p>

<h3>Binary Addition and Subtraction</h3>
<p>
  Read this subsection also, and see also my examples of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5hc0jaNbhU">adding numbers in binary</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2GzNvA3Z_E">subtracting numbers in binary</a>.  However, you might notice that subtraction in binary is pretty awful, since we often have to do so much borrowing!  We’ll see a better method for that soon (but not today).
</p>

<h3>Circuits for Computer Addition</h3>
<p>
  This subsection provides essential context, but you won’t be tested on it.  When I teach this material “live” in class, I use some rough sketches to hand-wave my way through it because it isn’t worth the class time to dig into every little detail.  So, definitely read it at least once, try to understand as much as you can, but don’t stress too much about things you don’t fully grasp.  (Feel free to ask me about them if you’re interested, though!)
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  You can stop here for now, unless you feel like reading ahead.  The next subsection introduces two’s complement, but in a very formal fashion and without a lot of context.  I’ll give my own introduction to this next class.
