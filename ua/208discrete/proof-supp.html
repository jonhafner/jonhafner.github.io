<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>Supplemental Proof Resources</h2>

<p>
  Below are two documents with advice for writing mathematical proofs, which we will do a fair amount of in Chapters 4–6.  Do not feel obligated to read these: it should suffice to imitate the style found in the textbook and my lecture notes.  However, if you would like more guidance, this may be a good starting point.  (In particular, if you plan to study the theory of mathematics or computer science in greater depth, and certainly if you plan to attend graduate school or pursue a career in academia, you might find a great deal of use in these documents.)

  <dt><a href="proof-writing-Hutchings.pdf">Introduction to mathematical arguments</a>, by Michael Hutchings</dt>
    <dd>This document is just what it says: an introduction to proofs.  Much of it provides a summary, elaboration, or alternate expression of many of the ideas covered in the textbook and in class, but it may also provide additional insight into the techniques and strategies of various specific types of proofs.  (Note that §&nbsp;4 deals with proofs of the type we discuss in §§&nbsp;5.2–5.4, and Appendix&nbsp;A is mostly material from Chapter&nbsp;6.)</dd>
  <dt><a href="proof-writing-Lee.pdf">Some Remarks on Writing Mathematical Proofs</a>, by John M. Lee</dt>
    <dd>This document focuses on the mechanics and style of writing mathematical text in general.  It addresses the matter of how to express your ideas, but not as much how to develop or organize them.  The focus is on writing suitable for publication, so some of its guidelines can be neglected in class for the sake of time and brevity; I certainly use many abbreviations and shortcuts when writing on the board, and I expect most of you to do similarly when working on a quiz or exam in class.  It may be worth practicing a more formal style when working on exercises and homework, however, and in any case, as with most forms of writing, it’s usually good to know what rules we’re breaking even when we actively choose to break them.</dd>

  Note that I have not read these documents thoroughly myself, merely skimmed them, so I cannot personally vouch for their content.  However, I’ll be more than happy to answer questions you may have about them if you can direct my attention to the relevant portions.
