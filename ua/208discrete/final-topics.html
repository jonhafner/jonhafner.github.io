<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>Outline of Final Exam Topics</h2>

<p>
  The final exam will sample material from most of this course, except as noted below.  Chapters 7 and 9 will be given somewhat disproportional weight since they were not tested earlier.  As usual, most questions will be pulled from or based on textbook exercises, so see individual section notes for suggestions for where to focus your attention.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Chapter 2:</dt>
    <dd>Sections 1–3 and 5.  (There will be no questions involving digital logic circuits, whether from § 2.4 or that portion of § 2.5.)</dd>
  <dt>Chapter 3:</dt>
    <dd>Sections 1–4 (entire chapter).</dd>
  <dt>Chapter 4:</dt>
    <dd>Sections 1–8 and 10 (we did not cover § 4.9).  We covered § 4.6 very lightly: as before, know how to compute with floor and ceiling, but you will not be asked to construct proofs involving them.  You will be asked to prove one of the two “famous theorems” from § 4.8, so be sure you are familiar with those classic proofs by contradiction.</dd>
  <dt>Chapter 5:</dt>
    <dd>Sections 1–3.  (Note the exclusion of § 5.4: you can expect ordinary induction [PMI] to appear, but there’s no need to test strong induction on this exam.)</dd>
  <dt>Chapter 6:</dt>
    <dd>Sections 1–3.</dd>
  <dt>Chapter 7:</dt>
    <dd>Sections 1–3.  (You will not be tested on § 7.4.)</dd>
  <dt>Chapter 9:</dt>
    <dd>Sections 1–3, 5, and 7.  (We discussed § 7.4, but the pigeonhole principle is not something I consider worth testing.)</dd>
