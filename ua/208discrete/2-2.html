<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>§ 2.2: Conditional Statements</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.  As usual, the additional examples are likely to be helpful in illustrating the ideas.  The second Remark at the end of the section elucidates some of the hazards of the ambiguous nature of informal speech.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  As usual, perhaps start with those with answers, and do as many more as are useful.
</p>
<p>
  In part (a) of #47–50, after the initial replacement, simplify as much as possible, justifying each step with the appropriate law from Theorem 2.1.1.  This is not only useful practice, it also usually makes part (b) much easier as a result!
</p>
<p>
  The exercises which appear to be most similar to possible test questions include #5–11, 20–23, 47(a), and 48(a).
