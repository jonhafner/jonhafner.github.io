<h1>Discrete Math</h1>

<h2>§ 9.3: Counting Elements of Disjoint Sets: The Addition Rule</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  As usual, most are potentially useful.  Those that look like plausible test questions include #1–8, 11–17, and 19–24.
</p>
<p>
  Exercises #31–32 walk you through evaluating the “birthday problem”, an interesting (and famous) result in probability.  You won’t be tested on this, but I strongly suggest working through it!
