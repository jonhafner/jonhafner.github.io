<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 16.4: Green’s Theorem</h2>

<h3>Green’s Theorem</h3>
<p>
  For our purposes, Green’s Theorem is primarily a utility formula that greatly simplifies the evaluation of some line integrals over closed curves.  Its application to that end is relatively straightforward; the most important thing to remember is to check for the correct orientation of the curve.  If the path is traversed clockwise instead of counterclockwise, we must remember to negate the result.  Examples 1 and 2 illustrate the basic application, and I also work through an example in “§ 16.4a: Green’s Theorem on a simple region” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjfJh4qLTEg">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://uakron.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=e8e64bcb-b88e-41a5-a068-ac8300f16d5b">Panopto</a>).

  As the text remarks, the LHS can be thought of as a line integral of some vector field <b>F</b>.  In that context, the somewhat peculiar integrand of the double integral on the RHS has additional meaning: it turns out that the expression <i>Q<sub>x</sub></i> − <i>P<sub>y</sub></i> describes the amount of counterclockwise rotation of <b>F</b> at each point in the plane.  (We will see more about that later.)  So, the LHS measures the “circulation” of the field along the path <i>C</i>, while the RHS measures the total amount of rotation of the field throughout the enclosed region <i>D</i>.  From that perspective, it is geometrically intuitive why the two expressions should be related.

<h3>Finding Areas with Green’s Theorem</h3>
<p>
  Green’s Theorem works in both directions, of course: we usually use it to change a line integral into a double integral, but it is possible to do the reverse.  In general, it can be difficult to reconstruct the appropriate <i>P</i> and <i>Q</i>, but there are certain special cases where this is feasible.  One such case is when the integrand is 1, as this subsection discusses.  The application to finding areas is somewhat interesting, in my opinion—especially the business about planimeters—but not a major topic you need to worry about.  Some exercises ask about it, but you can simply refer back to the formulae for those.  You will not be responsible for this application on the final exam.

<h3>Extended Versions of Green’s Theorem</h3>
<p>
  This subsection is mostly concerned with justifying Green’s Theorem on regions more complex than those considered initially.  The main lesson to learn here is that we can apply the theorem even to regions that contain “holes”, such as depicted in Figure 9.  The “trick” is that the positively oriented boundary runs <em>clockwise</em> around a hole.  (It might help to consider that a more “local” version of the rule for positive orientation is that if you imagine yourself standing on the path and walking along it, you want to keep the region <i>D</i> to your left.)  I work through an example of this in “§ 16.4b: Green’s Theorem with a hole (Exercise #12)” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7ofpuyALt4">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://uakron.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=0f681f12-8b93-4d89-9c9e-ac8300f12605">Panopto</a>).
