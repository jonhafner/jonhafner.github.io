<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>Expectations and advice</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Expectations:</strong>  We expect that you are fully capable with all material from the main sequence: arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and Calculus I&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;II.  In particular, you will need to be able to quickly and accurately apply the standard techniques of differentiation and integration.  You will need to be able to differentiate all the standard basic functions, as well as their products, quotients, and compositions.  You will also need to be able to integrate common functions, including trigonometric forms, and apply basic integration techniques such as substitution and integration by parts.  (Fortunately, partial fractions and trigonometric substitutions do not come up often in this class; if they do, you can review those methods as needed.)  Infinite series also do not see much use here, but parametric equations and polar coördinates will be used extensively!  Make sure you review any topics you think might give you trouble, and ask me questions if you encounter difficulties.
</p>
<p>
  Our textbook can obviously serve as a review of previous calculus material, but it also includes reviews of pre-calculus topics in Appendices A–D and Chapter&nbsp;1.  If you think you might be rusty on any of these topics, or have missed one or two points in your previous education, you might wish to give them a skim and watch out for anything you are less familiar with.
</p>
<p>
  (Tangentially related, a topic that <em>used</em> to be covered in an appendix in earlier editions but has since been relegated to an online supplement is “<a href="https://stewartcalculus.com/_update/media/common/liesmycomp_stu.pdf">Lies My Calculator and Computer Told Me</a>”.  This short document explores some very important points to keep in mind whenever using technology to assist our calculations, and I strongly recommend reading it at your earliest convenience.)
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Advice:</strong> One of the best things you can do early on is to carefully read and consider Dr.&nbsp;Kreider’s advice for <a href="http://math.uakron.edu/~kreider/calc1/success.pdf">Being Prepared For Calculus</a>.  (It was written for his Calculus I class, but I feel it applies to most mathematics courses at the 100–300 level.)
</p>
<p>
  The only thing I would add to that advice is some discussion of scheduling and pacing.  You may have heard the rule of thumb that you can generally expect to spend two to three hours outside of class for every hour you spend in class.  That means that for a four-credit-hour class such as ours, you can expect to need eight to twelve hours per week for reading, homework, studying for tests, etc.  (Some of you may be able to get away with less, but some of you may need more!)  That averages out to about an hour or two per day.
</p>
<p>
  That average is important to observe, since human brains tend to learn best in short-ish shifts; some experts advise 20 minutes, but in my experience, as your mathematical studies advance, it can feel like you’re barely digging in after such a short time!  You might find something closer to 60–90 minutes at a time to be more productive for you, in which case you might want to aim for approximately one or two sessions per day, almost every day.  Keeping these at fixed, consistent times can be helpful, but even if not, simply spreading them out a bit helps.  There’s often a limit to how much new math you can cram into your head at once; your brain needs some time to “digest” new ideas, so taking a break after a while to do other things—or even better, get some sleep—can help you form better memories and connections.
</p>
<p>
  What you absolutely <em>do not</em> want to do is the opposite of this, trying to grind out an entire section or two’s worth of studying and homework on the day it’s due!  Much of what you try to learn probably isn’t going to make much sense, you’re likely to get stumped by some problems and not have the time to let them stew in the back of your head for a while, and even if you can manage to figure things out, you’re going to be tired and miserable after a marathon session of grinding through problem sets.  I assure you that I personally understand the tendency to procrastinate all too well, so please believe me when I tell you that it’s a terrible experience!  If it’s at all possible to do so, you are likely to find your studies to be much more pleasant, efficient, and effective if you can spread them out across multiple sessions of reasonable length.

  Most of the advice above can help you regardless of whether you’re having trouble and struggling to improve, or if you’re already doing well and want to do even better.  If you find yourself in that latter group, you may be seeking ways to further hone your skills and stretch your abilities.  I suggest first reading the exercises in the textbook and attempting some of the more interesting ones not already covered by the assignments in WebAssign.  Also take a look at the projects following some sections, and the “Problems Plus” sets after each chapter.<!-- Additional challenge problems can be found on the main website for the textbook; last I checked, they don’t seem to have posted a 9th edition update yet, but <a href="https://www.stewartcalculus.com/data/default/upfiles/8et_challprobs_student.pdf">here are the challenge problems for the 8th</a>. *** NB: Currently only goes up to Chapter 10, so no Calc3! -->
