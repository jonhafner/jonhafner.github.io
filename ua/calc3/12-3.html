<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 12.3: The Dot Product</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.  Note that Theorem 2: Properties of the Dot Product points out some properties that are analogous to real-number multiplication.
</p>
<p>
  I suggest skipping over the subsection on Direction Angles and Direction Cosines on your first pass, returning after you understand Projections, as I personally feel that the former are much more comprehensible when viewed through the lens of the latter.  (If you read about Projections in the eBook, you might also find it helpful to play around with the “Explore &amp; Test” tab of the “Explore It”, but I do <em>not</em> recommend watching the “Example Video” while you’re in there—the narrator uses unusual phrasing and incorrect notation.)

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–52
</p>
<p>
  Not all applications of vectors are geometric or physical; #14 is a simple illustration that hints at broader uses in the information sciences.
</p>
<p>
  The three exercises #61–63 state some broader principles that might be worth thinking about; the first two in particular are commonly used throughout higher analysis.  At the very least, make sure you understand #62(a)!
