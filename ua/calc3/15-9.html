<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 15.9: Change of Variables in Multiple Integrals</h2>
<p>
  It’s easy to get lost in the technicalities, so let me call out the main ideas in the order that the textbook brings them up:
</p>
<p>
  From the introduction, the Substitution Rule, a.k.a. <i>u</i>-sub, is an example of what is more broadly described as a “change of variable(s)”.  Recall that after we identified a substitution, we had to do three things: translate the integrand to the new variable, find the appropriate differential, and adjust the bounds to the corresponding interval in the new variable.
</p>
<p>
  With double integrals, we have already been using a specific change of variables, namely a conversion to polar coördinates.  Note that this has the same three elements: we need to translate the integrand and region of integration to the new variables, and even the differential <i>dA</i> changes, slipping in a scaling factor of <i>r</i>.  This is to account for the way the transformation changes the shape of the space and distorts areas.
</p>
<p>
  Don’t let the new terminology intimidate you: a “transformation” is simply a kind of function.  Here, we’re looking at transformations in ℝ², but some ideas might become clearer if I give examples from just ℝ.  Consider, for example, the squaring function <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) = <i>x</i>².  This is a transformation that maps each real value to its square.  Since <i>f</i>(3) = 9, we can say that 9 is the <em>image</em> of 3 under <i>f</i>.  If we apply the function to a set, the set of outputs is its image; so, for example, the image of [0,2] is the interval [0,4].  The transformations discussed in the text here are similar, except they are functions that map ordered pairs to ordered pairs.
</p>
<p>
  After Definition 7 of the Jacobian, pay special attention to Theorem 9 and the discussion immediately following it, particularly the return to the polar conversion as an example of a transformation.  Observe how the Jacobian calculates for us precisely the factor of <i>r</i> required for integrating!
</p>
<p>
  All we’re doing here, then, is looking at how to translate double (and triple) integrals with transformations other than the standard ones.  In most exercises, you will be provided with an appropriate transformation to use; when you are not, compare the problem to examples and other exercises with similar structures for a hint.  From there, you need only do the same three steps I described above, in any order: find the new region of integration, translate the integrand to the new variables, and calculate (using the Jacobian) the scaling factor between differentials.
</p>
<p>
  I work through a relatively thorough example in “§ 15.9: Integrating over a parallelogram” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNOO6lVzbVU">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://uakron.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=15de70cb-77b4-4c5c-b03d-ac7d00de88f5">Panopto</a>), in which I also reinforce what the Jacobian means and how it relates to polar transformations.
