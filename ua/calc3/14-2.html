<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 14.2: Limits and Continuity</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section, with emphasis on the concepts.  This section is of considerable importance conceptually but is not worth devoting much class time to.  I encourage you to read and think about this material and keep it in mind moving forward, but you will not be tested on its contents.  (I won’t ask about it on my tests, and I’ve never known it to be on the final exam either.)
