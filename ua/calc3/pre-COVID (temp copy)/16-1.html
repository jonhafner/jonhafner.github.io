<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 16.1*: Vector Fields</h2>

<h3><a href="16-1-handout.pdf">Handout</a></h3>

<p>This section is mostly unmodified.  However, to fill out a bit more on the topic of conservative vector fields, and to prepare us for some of the material in § 16.5*, I’m bringing in a little bit of the content of § 16.3, regarding identifying whether a two-dimensional vector field is conservative, and if so, how to find its potential function.  I will present the essentials in class, and you can find more information on pp. 1090–2 in the textbook.  <!-- pp. 1078–80 in 7e -->  (For now, ignore all the bits about line integrals.)</p>

<p>You may wish to practice a few of those problems before tackling the three-dimensional case in § 16.5*.  Exercises #3–10 in § 16.3 most directly pertain to this.  In WebAssign, the relevant problems are #3–5 on the homework and #2 on the quiz.</p>
