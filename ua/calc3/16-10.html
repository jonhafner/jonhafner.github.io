<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 16.10: Summary</h2>
<p>
  This “section” is only a single page in the textbook; I normally devote a few minutes of class time to it, in which I distribute and discuss <a href="summary-handout.pdf">this handout</a>.  The first page is simply a reproduction of this page from (an earlier edition of) the textbook.  On the second page, I have rewritten Green’s Theorem in its two vector forms, tweaked the notations used to emphasize the essential similarities and the evaluations along the boundaries, and grouped them into “divergence theorems” and “curl theorems”, to make the point that there are really only two main types of theorems here: one relates the amount of divergence within a region to the “spillover” across its boundary, and the other relates the rotation within a surface or planar region to the circulation around its boundary.  Personally, I find the observation and recognition of those essential similarities to make it much easier to remember the various theorems, understand what they mean, and see when and how to apply them.  Perhaps this will help some of you as well!
