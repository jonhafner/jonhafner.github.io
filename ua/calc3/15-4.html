<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 15.4: Applications of Double Integrals</h2>
<p>
  First, a clarification for those of you who are confused by the terminology: a “lamina” is any plate or sheet of material that is thin enough that we can ignore its actual thickness, treating it as perfectly flat and two-dimensional for the purposes at hand.  The actual measurements involved will depend on your application and the scale at which you’re working.  Mathematically, we represent it as a region in a plane.
</p>
<p>
  A few notes to help you make efficient use of the textbook:
</p>

<h3>Density and Mass</h3>
<p>
  Note that if density <i>ρ</i> (that’s the Greek letter rho, not the Latin p) measures mass per unit area, then when you multiply it by an area, you get a mass.  Thus, if you multiply the density at a point by a differential area, you get a differential mass: <i>ρ dA</i> = <i>dm</i>.  If you then sum (integrate) all those differential masses, you obtain the total mass over the region!  That’s basically all that’s going on here.  (Similar principles apply for other types of density, such as electric charge.)
</p>

<h3>Moments and Centers of Mass</h3>
<p>
  The foundations of this topic are discussed more thoroughly in § 8.3; you can follow the link in the textbook, then advance to the subsection by this name.  Questions about balance, leverage, and support often entail calculation of moments.  The text and figures in § 8.3 lay a lot of the groundwork, but once they start talking about integrals, you can stop reading there and return to the present section, whose content is more general and replaces those narrow formulae.
</p>
<p>
  The general summary “moment = mass × distance” explains the forms of the moments given in this section: the moment about the <i>x</i>-axis is the distance from the <i>x</i>-axis (namely, <i>y</i>) times the mass at that point, <i>ρ dA</i>, while the moment about the <i>y</i>-axis is the distance from the <i>y</i>-axis (<i>x</i>) times the mass.  This is why the notations seem to “switch” the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.  If you look at the summary in box 5, you can see that the coördinates of the center of mass are basically the “weighted averages” of the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coördinates, respectively.
</p>
<p>
  I work through an example of this type of problem in “§ 15.4: Mass and center of mass” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOmEGth7zdY">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://uakron.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=82fc48d5-7280-4916-b7ab-ac7500f5d854">Panopto</a>).
</p>

<h3>Other applications</h3>
<p>
  The remaining applications are not emphasized in this course; I’ve never seen them appear on a final exam, for instance, and I never test them myself.  However, they are useful and interesting, so I encourage you to at least skim these subsections and their corresponding exercises.  If any seem applicable to your studies or interests, give them a try.
</p>
<p>
  Moments of inertia (second moments) and radii of gyration operate similarly to first moments and centers of mass, just with slightly more complicated formulae; these concepts are important in physics, and I assume also in mechanical engineering.
</p>
<p>
  Probability and Expected Values are statistical concepts with myriad applications across a broad range of disciplines, as the examples and exercises might suggest.
