<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 16.5: Curl and Divergence</h2>

<h3>Curl</h3>
<p>
  I remarked in <a href="16-4.html">my notes for the previous section</a> that the expression <i>Q<sub>x</sub></i> − <i>P<sub>y</sub></i> describes the amount of counterclockwise rotation of <b>F</b> at each point in the <i>xy</i>-plane.  Using the right-hand rule in a fashion similar to how we describe torque, we could take that value as a coefficient on <b>k̂</b>, i.e., a vector component in the <i>z</i>-direction.  Analogous expressions can be developed for the other planes; combining these gives the expression in Definition 1 for describing the total “curl” of a three-dimensional vector field.  This is difficult to memorize, so I suggest reading through the work that follows it to develop the shorthand “definition” in formula 2.  That’s the form that I always use myself when computing curl, as in Example 1.
</p>
<p>
  Read the rest of this subsection carefully.  In the discussion of conservative vector fields, recall that for a two-dimensional field, we checked whether <i>Q<sub>x</sub></i> = <i>P<sub>y</sub></i>; observe that this is true if and only if <i>Q<sub>x</sub></i> − <i>P<sub>y</sub></i> = 0.  Applying similar principles to the other components, we see that the conditions we get from Clairaut’s Theorem are equivalent to checking whether the curl equals the zero vector.
</p>

<h3>Divergence</h3>
<p>
  Read this subsection carefully.  Theorem 11 and the Laplace operator are good things to be aware of, but I don’t think you’ll be responsible for them on the exam.  If they show up in exercises, just refer back to the text.  The rest of the subsection is very important, however.
</p>

<h3>Vector Forms of Green’s Theorem</h3>
<p>
  If we think of the gradient as a sort of “derivative” of a scalar field, then curl and divergence are two kinds of “derivatives” of vector fields.  They both measure how a field changes, but in different ways: divergence measures how it expands or contracts, and curl measures how it rotates.
</p>
<p>
  Both of these, as it turns out, relate to Green’s Theorem, as described in this subsection.  This subsection is optional—you will not be responsible for its content.  However, if you want to gain a bit more intuitive and geometric insight into Green’s Theorem, and to lay some groundwork for Stokes’ Theorem and the Divergence Theorem in later sections, this subsection is worth reading and thinking about.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–12, 15–24
</p>
<p>
  I strongly urge you to also work through #14 very carefully, as it is a good test and exploration of some very important skills and concepts.
</p>
<p>
  Exercise #40 presents forms of Maxwell’s equations for electromagnetism for a common special case.  If this is related to your studies (e.g., physics, electrical engineering), you might find it interesting to pursue this further.
