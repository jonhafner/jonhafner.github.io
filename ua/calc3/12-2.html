<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 12.2: Vectors</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.  Note that the Properties of Vectors in the box on p. 840 (after Example 4) tell us that vector addition and scalar multiplication are associative, commutative, and distributive, <b>0</b> is the additive identity, and 1 is the multiplicative identity.  This is analogous to the algebra of real numbers.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–33
</p>
<p>
  I would suggest that you also work #41 and #43, and at least read #52.
