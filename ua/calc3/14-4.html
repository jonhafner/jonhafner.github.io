<h1>Calculus III</h1>

<h2>§ 14.4: Tangent Planes and Linear Approximations</h2>

<h3>Suggested Reading</h3>
<p>
  Entire section.  We won’t ask you to use Definition 7 (differentiable), but it is important to be aware that, like continuity, differentiability is somewhat more complex with multivariate functions.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
  Departmental suggestions: #1–10, 15–25, 31–34
</p>
<p>
  I also suggest you read through #41–50 and work through <em>at least one</em> of them.
